Last Updated : 01 Apr, 2024
The `mv` command in Linux is like a superhero tool that can do a bunch of cool stuff with your files and folders. Think of it as a digital moving truck that helps you shift things around in your computer. Whether you want to tidy up your folders, give your files new names, or send them to different places, `mv` is the go-to friend for the job. It’s a basic tool that every person using Linux should know about. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how you can use the mv command for different tasks, and I’ll show you step-by-step examples to make it super easy to understand. So, buckle up, and let’s explore the many tricks the mv command has up its sleeve!

In UNIX-based operating systems like Linux and macOS, `mv` stands for “move”. But in this article, we will be talking about the “mv command in Linux”. As its name suggests this command is used to rename file directories and move files from one location to another within a file system.

Syntax of mv command in Linux
The Basic Syntax for mv command in linux is mentioned below.

mv [options(s)] [source_file_name(s)] [Destination_file_name]

Here,

source_file_name(s) = The name of the files that we want to rename or move.
Destination_file_name = The name of the new location or the name of the file.

### Examples of mv Command
#### 1. How to Rename a file in Linux Using mv Command
Syntax:

mv [source_file_name(s)] [Destination_file_name]
Enter your source file name in place of [source_file_name(s)] and your destination file name in place of [Destination_file_name].

For Example:

If we have a file “name = jayesh_gfg” and want to rename it to “name = geeksforgeeks”.

mv jayesh_gfg geeksforgeeks
mv jayesh_gfg geeksforgeeks
mv jayesh_gfg geeksforgeeks

Here we used the `ls` command to see the files and directories in the following location.

This command is renamed `jayesh_gfg` to `geeksforgeeks`. If `geeksforgeeks` already exists, in that case, it will be overwritten without prompting for confirmation.

#### 2. How to Move a File in Linux Using mv Command
Syntax:

mv [source_file_name(s)] [Destination_path]
Enter your source file name in place of [source_file_name(s)] and your destination path in place of [Destination_path].

For Example:

If we have a file “name = geeksforgeeks” and want to move it to location “name = /home/jayeshkumar/jkj”.

mv geeksforgeeks /home/jayeshkumar/jkj/
mv geeksforgeeks /home/jayeshkumar/jkj/
mv geeksforgeeks /home/jayeshkumar/jkj/

Here we used the `ls` command to see the files and directories in the following location.

This command moved file “name = `geeksforgeeks`” to the destination “name = “/home.jayeshkumar/jkj/”.

#### 3. How to Move Multiple files in Linux Using mv Command
Syntax:

mv [source_file_name_1] [source_file_name_2] [source_file_name_ .....] [Destination_path]

Enter your source file names in place of [source_file_name_1…..] and your destination path in place of [Destination_path].

For Example:

If we have a file “name = gfg_1 , gfg_2” and want to move it to location “name = /home/jayeshkumar/jkj”.

mv gfg_1 gfg_2 /home/jayeshkumar/jkj/

mv gfg_1 gfg_2 /home/jayeshkumar/jkj/
mv gfg_1 gfg_2 /home/jayeshkumar/jkj/

Here we used the `ls` command to see the files and directories in the following location.

This command moved file “name = `gfg_1 and gfg_2`” to the destination “name = “/home.jayeshkumar/jkj/”.

#### 4. How to Rename a directory in Linux  Using mv Command in Linux
Syntax:

mv [source_directory_name(s)] [Destination_directory_name]

Enter your source directory name in place of [source_directory_name(s)] and your destination directory name in place of [Destination_directory_name].

For Example:

If we have a directory “name = jkj” and want to rename it to “name = new_gfg”.

mv jkj new_gfg

mv jkj new_gfg
mv jkj new_gfg

Here we used `ls` command to see the files and directories in the following location.

This command renames `jkj` to `new_gfg`. If `new_gfg` already exists, in that case it will be overwritten without prompting for confirmation.

### Options Available in mv Command
#### 1. -i (interactive)
The “-i” option makes the “mv” command ask for confirmation before overwriting an existing file. If the file doesn’t exist, it will simply rename or move it without prompting.

Syntax:

mv -i [source_file/directory_name(s)] [Destination_file/directory_name/path]

Enter your source file/directory name in place of [source_file/directory_name(s)] and your destination file/directory name/path in place of [Destination_file/directory_name/path].

For Example:

If we have a file “name = jayesh_gfg” and want to rename it to existing file “name = geeksforgeeks”.

mv -i jayesh_gfg geeksforgeeks

mv -i jayesh_gfg geeksforgeeks
mv -i jayesh_gfg geeksforgeeks

Here we used `ls` command to see the files and directories in the following location.

Here we have to give permission by typing yes = `y` and no =`n`.

#### 2. -f (Force)
mv prompts for confirmation overwriting the destination file if a file is write-protected. The -f option overrides this minor protection and overwrites the destination file forcefully and deletes the source file. 

Syntax:

mv -f [source_file/directory_name(s)] [Destination_file/directory_name/path]

Enter your source file/directory name in place of [source_file/directory_name(s)] and your destination file/directory name/path in place of [Destination_file/directory_name/path].

For Example:

If we have a file “name = gfg” and want to rename it to existing file “name = geeksforgeeks”.

mv -f gfg geeksforgeeks

mv -f gfg geeksforgeeks
mv -f gfg geeksforgeeks

Here we used `ls` command to see the files and directories in the following location.

#### 3. -n (no-clobber)
 With -n option, mv prevents an existing file from being overwritten.

Syntax:

mv -n [source_file/directory_name(s)] [Destination_file/directory_name/path]

Enter your source file/directory name in place of [source_file/directory_name(s)] and your destination file/directory name/path in place of [Destination_file/directory_name/path].

For Example:

If we have a file “name = oldfile” and want to rename it to existing file “name = newfile”.

mv -n oldfile newfile

mv -n oldfile newfile
mv -n oldfile newfile

Here we used `ls` command to see the files and directories in the following location.

#### 4. -b(backup)
With this option, it is easier to take a backup of an existing file that will be overwritten as a result of the mv command. This will create a backup file with the tilde character (~) appended to it. 

Syntax:

mv -b [source_file/directory_name(s)] [Destination_file/directory_name/path]

Enter your source file/directory name in place of [source_file/directory_name(s)] and your destination file/directory name/path in place of [Destination_file/directory_name/path].

For Example:

If we have a file “name = first_file” and want to rename it to existing file “name = second_file”.

mv -b first_file second_file

mv -b first_file second_file
mv -b first_file second_file

Here we used `ls` command to see the files and directories in the following location.

#### 5. –version
 This option is used to display the version of mv which is currently running on your system. 

Syntax:

mv --version

### **`file` Command in Linux**  
The `file` command in Linux is used to **determine the type of a file**. It does this by analyzing the file’s content rather than relying on its extension. This helps identify text files, scripts, binaries, compressed files, and more.

---

## **Syntax**  
```sh
file [OPTIONS] FILE
```
- `FILE` → The name of the file you want to check.

---

## **Basic Usage**  
To check the type of a file:  
```sh
file filename
```
### **Example:**  
```sh
file myfile.txt
```
**Output:**  
```
myfile.txt: ASCII text
```

```sh
file script.sh
```
**Output:**  
```
script.sh: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable
```

---

### **Common File Types Identified by `file`**
| File Type | Example Output |
|-----------|---------------|
| Plain text file | `ASCII text` |
| Shell script | `Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable` |
| Python script | `Python script, ASCII text executable` |
| Binary file | `ELF 64-bit LSB executable` |
| Compressed file | `gzip compressed data` |
| Image file | `JPEG image data` |
| PDF file | `PDF document, version 1.7` |

---

### **Useful Options**
### **1. Check Multiple Files**  
You can check multiple files at once:  
```sh
file file1 file2 file3
```
**Example Output:**  
```
file1: ASCII text
file2: JPEG image data
file3: gzip compressed data
```

### **2. Show MIME Type (`-i` option)**  
Instead of the default description, show the **MIME type**:  
```sh
file -i myfile.txt
```
**Output:**  
```
myfile.txt: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
```
This is useful when working with web servers or file validation.

### **3. Follow Symbolic Links (`-L` option)**  
By default, `file` reports the type of a **symlink** itself. To check the actual file:  
```sh
file -L symlinkfile
```

### **4. Suppress File Name in Output (`-b` option)**  
If you only want the type, without the file name:  
```sh
file -b myfile.txt
```
**Output:**  
```
ASCII text
```

### **5. Analyze a Compressed File (`-z` option)**  
If the file is compressed, `file` normally just says it’s compressed. Use `-z` to look **inside** compressed files:  
```sh
file -z archive.gz
```

---

## **Real-World Use Cases**
1. **Identify unknown files:**  
   ```sh
   file unknownfile
   ```
2. **Check if a script is a shell or Python script:**  
   ```sh
   file script.sh
   ```
3. **Verify if a file is corrupted or unrecognized:**  
   ```sh
   file somefile
   ```
4. **Find out the encoding of a text file:**  
   ```sh
   file -i document.txt
   ```

---

## **Conclusion**  
The `file` command is a simple yet powerful tool for identifying file types in Linux. It doesn’t rely on file extensions but actually examines the file’s content. 🚀
