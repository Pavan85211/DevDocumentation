## grep command in Unix/Linux
The grep command in Unix/Linux is a powerful tool used for searching and manipulating text patterns within files. Its name is derived from the ed (editor) command g/re/p (globally search for a regular expression and print matching lines), which reflects its core functionality. grep is widely used by programmers, system administrators, and users alike for its efficiency and versatility in handling text data. In this article, we will explore the various aspects of the grep command.

## Sample Commands

Consider the following file `geekfile.txt` as an input:

```bash
unix is great os. unix was developed in Bell labs.
learn operating system.
Unix linux which one you choose.
uNix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.
```

### Practical Examples of `grep` Command

#### 1. Case Insensitive Search
The `-i` option enables case-insensitive search for a string in the given file.

```bash
grep -i "UNix" geekfile.txt
```
Output:
```
unix is great os. unix was developed in Bell labs.
Unix linux which one you choose.
uNix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.
```

#### 2. Displaying the Count of Matches
The `-c` option will show the count of lines that match the pattern.

```bash
grep -c "unix" geekfile.txt
```
Output:
```
4
```

#### 3. Displaying File Names that Match the Pattern
The `-l` option displays the names of files that contain the search pattern.

```bash
grep -l "unix" *
```

Output:
```
geekfile.txt
```

#### 4. Checking for Whole Words
The `-w` option matches the pattern as a whole word, not as part of another word.

```bash
grep -w "unix" geekfile.txt
```
Output:
```
unix is great os. unix was developed in Bell labs.
uNix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.
```

#### 5. Display Only the Matched Pattern
The `-o` option prints only the matched string.

```bash
grep -o "unix" geekfile.txt
```
Output:
```
unix
unix
unix
unix
```

#### 6. Show Line Numbers
The `-n` option will show the line numbers where the matches occur.

```bash
grep -n "unix" geekfile.txt
```
Output:
```
1:unix is great os. unix was developed in Bell labs.
3:Unix linux which one you choose.
4:uNix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.
```

#### 7. Inverting the Pattern Match
The `-v` option inverts the match, showing lines that do **not** contain the pattern.

```bash
grep -v "unix" geekfile.txt
```
Output:
```
learn operating system.
```

#### 8. Matching Lines that Start with a String
The `^` regular expression matches the start of a line.

```bash
grep "^unix" geekfile.txt
```
Output:
```
unix is great os. unix was developed in Bell labs.
```

#### 9. Matching Lines that End with a String
The `$` regular expression matches the end of a line.

```bash
grep "os$" geekfile.txt
```

Output:
```
unix is great os. unix was developed in Bell labs.
```

#### 10. Using Multiple Expressions with `-e`
The `-e` option allows you to specify multiple patterns.

```bash
grep -e "Agarwal" -e "Aggarwal" -e "Agrawal" geekfile.txt
```

#### 11. Using Patterns from a File
The `-f` option reads patterns from a file.

Create a file `pattern.txt`:
```
Agarwal
Aggarwal
Agrawal
```

Search using the `-f` option:
```bash
grep -f pattern.txt geekfile.txt
```

#### 12. Printing Specific Lines
The `-A`, `-B`, and `-C` options allow you to print specific lines around the match:

- `-A n`: Prints `n` lines after the match.
- `-B n`: Prints `n` lines before the match.
- `-C n`: Prints `n` lines before and after the match.

```bash
grep -A1 "learn" geekfile.txt
```
Output:
```
learn operating system.
uNix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.
```

#### 13. Searching Recursively for a Pattern in a Directory
The `-R` option allows you to search recursively in a directory.

```bash
grep -iR "geeks" /home/geeks
```

Output:
```
./geeks2.txt:Well Hello Geeks
./geeks1.txt:I am a big time geek
```

Here's a structured Git document for the content you provided on the `sed` command:

---

# **SED Command in Unix/Linux**

The **SED** (Stream Editor) command in Unix/Linux is a powerful utility used to process and manipulate text in files. It allows for various operations like searching, find-and-replace, insertion, deletion, and more, without the need to open the file in an editor. This makes `sed` highly efficient, especially when working with large files or automating tasks in scripts.

## **SED Syntax**
```
sed [OPTIONS] 'SCRIPT' [INPUTFILE...]
```

### Where:
- **`OPTIONS`**: Optional flags to modify the behavior of the `sed` command.
- **`SCRIPT`**: Defines the command(s) to execute on the input file.
- **`INPUTFILE`**: One or more input files to be processed.

## **Commonly Used Options in SED**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-i`   | Edit the file in place (overwrite the file) without printing to the console. |
| `-n`   | Suppress automatic printing of lines. |
| `-e`   | Allows multiple commands to be executed. |
| `-f`   | Reads `sed` commands from a file instead of the command line. |
| `-r`   | Enables extended regular expressions. |

- `[FILE]`: Name(s) of the file(s) to be processed.

---

## **Practical Examples of `cat` Command**

### 1. **View the Content of a Single File**

The most basic use of `cat` is to display the content of a file on the terminal:

```bash
cat file_name
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat jayesh.txt
```

### 2. **View the Content of Multiple Files**

You can view multiple files by specifying their names in order:

```bash
cat file1 file2
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```

### 3. **View File Contents with Line Numbers**

Use the `-n` option to display line numbers alongside file content:

```bash
cat -n file_name
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat -n file2.txt
```

### 4. **Create and Add Content to a New File**

Use `cat` with the `>` operator to create a new file and add content:

```bash
cat > newfile_name
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat > jayesh1.txt
```

After typing your content, press **Ctrl+D** to save and exit.

### 5. **Copy Contents of One File to Another**

Use `cat` with the redirection operator `>` to copy contents from one file to another:

```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt > merged_file.txt
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt > merged_file.txt
```

### 6. **Suppress Repeated Empty Lines**

The `-s` option suppresses consecutive empty lines in the output:

```bash
cat -s file_name
```

### 7. **Append File Contents**

Use `cat` with the `>>` operator to append the content of one file to another:

```bash
cat file1 >> file2
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat file1.txt >> file2.txt
```

### 8. **Reverse File Contents**

Use the `tac` command to display file contents in reverse order:

```bash
tac file_name
```

**Example:**

```bash
tac file2.txt
```

### 9. **Highlight the End of Line**

The `-E` option highlights the end of each line with a `$` symbol:

```bash
cat -E file_name
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat -E jayesh1.txt
```

### 10. **Use the `-A` Option**

The `-A` option combines `-v`, `-E`, and `-T` to display non-printing characters, end-of-line symbols, and tab characters:

```bash
cat -A file_name
```

### 11. **Handle Dashed Files**

Use the `--` option to handle files with dashes at the beginning of their names:

```bash
cat -- "-file_name"
```

**Example:**
