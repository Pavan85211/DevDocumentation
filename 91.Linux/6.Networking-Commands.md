### 1. **`ifconfig` Command in Linux**  
The `ifconfig` (interface configuration) command is used to **configure, manage, and display network interfaces** in Linux. It allows users to check IP addresses, enable/disable network interfaces, assign new IPs, and manage network settings.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** In modern Linux distributions, `ifconfig` has been deprecated and replaced by `ip` command (`ip addr show`). However, it is still available in older systems and can be installed manually.

---

## **Syntax**
```sh
ifconfig [interface] [options]
```
- `interface` ‚Üí The name of the network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).
- `[options]` ‚Üí Various options for configuring the interface.

---

## **Basic Usage**
### **1. Display Network Configuration**
```sh
ifconfig
```
or for a specific interface:
```sh
ifconfig eth0
```
**Example Output:**
```
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
      inet 192.168.1.100  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
      ether 00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e  txqueuelen 1000
```
- `inet` ‚Üí IPv4 address
- `netmask` ‚Üí Subnet mask
- `broadcast` ‚Üí Broadcast address
- `ether` ‚Üí MAC address

---

## **Configuring Network Interfaces**
### **2. Assign an IP Address**
To set an IP address `192.168.1.100` to `eth0`:
```sh
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

### **3. Enable (Activate) an Interface**
To bring up an interface:
```sh
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
```
This enables `eth0` and allows network communication.

### **4. Disable (Deactivate) an Interface**
To disable a network interface:
```sh
sudo ifconfig eth0 down
```
This disables `eth0`, cutting off network access.

### **5. Change MAC Address**
To set a new MAC address for `eth0`:
```sh
sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
This is useful for privacy or bypassing MAC-based network restrictions.

---

## **Viewing Network Statistics**
To see packet statistics for an interface:
```sh
ifconfig eth0
```
or use:
```sh
ifconfig -a
```
It shows:
- **RX (Received) and TX (Transmitted) packets**
- Errors, dropped packets, collisions

---

## **Alternatives to `ifconfig`**
Since `ifconfig` is deprecated, use:
- **Check IP addresses:**  
  ```sh
  ip addr show
  ```
- **Enable/disable interface:**  
  ```sh
  ip link set eth0 up
  ip link set eth0 down
  ```

---

## **Conclusion**
The `ifconfig` command is useful for **checking and configuring network interfaces**, but it has been replaced by the `ip` command in newer Linux versions. However, if you're working with older distributions, `ifconfig` remains a powerful tool. üöÄ

## 2.**`ip` Command in Linux (Detailed Explanation)**  

The `ip` command is a **powerful and modern** replacement for the deprecated `ifconfig` command. It is used to **display, configure, and manage network interfaces, IP addresses, routing, and tunnels** in Linux.  

### **üìå Why Use `ip` Instead of `ifconfig`?**  
- Supports **IPv4 and IPv6**.  
- Can manage **multiple IP addresses** on a single interface.  
- Provides **detailed routing** and network configurations.  
- More powerful and **actively maintained** in modern Linux distributions.  

---

## **üìù Basic Syntax**
```sh
ip [OPTIONS] OBJECT {COMMAND} 
```
- `OBJECT`: Defines what you want to manage (e.g., `addr`, `link`, `route`).  
- `COMMAND`: The operation you want to perform (e.g., `show`, `add`, `delete`).  

### **üîπ Common Objects in `ip` Command**
| Object | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `addr` | Manage IP addresses |
| `link` | Manage network interfaces |

```

---

### **üåê 3. Assigning and Removing IP Addresses**  
#### **Assign an IP Address to an Interface**
```sh
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.200/24 dev eth0
```
#### **Remove an IP Address**
```sh
sudo ip addr del 192.168.1.200/24 dev eth0
```
#### **Make an IP Address Persistent**
- The above changes are **temporary** and will be lost after a reboot.  
- To make them **permanent**, modify the network configuration files (`/etc/network/interfaces` or `/etc/netplan/` in Ubuntu).  

---

### **üö¶ 4. Managing Routes**  
#### **Show the Routing Table**
```sh
ip route show
```
or simply:
```sh
ip r
```
**Example Output:**
```
default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link
```
- `default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0` ‚Üí Default gateway  
- `192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0` ‚Üí Local subnet  

#### **Add a New Route**
```sh
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
```
- Routes packets for `192.168.2.0/24` through `192.168.1.1`.  

#### **Delete a Route**
```sh
sudo ip route del 192.168.2.0/24

```

---

### **üìå 6. Working with IP Rules**
Routing rules define how packets are forwarded.  
#### **View Routing Rules**
```sh
ip rule show
```
####**Add a Custom Routing Rule**
```sh
sudo ip rule add from 192.168.1.50 table 100
```
- Traffic from `192.168.1.50` will use **routing table 100**.  

#### **Delete a Routing Rule**
```sh
sudo ip rule del from 192.168.1.50 table 100
```

---

### **üîÑ 7. Flushing IP Configuration (Resetting Network)**
If you want to remove all assigned IP addresses from an interface:
```sh
sudo ip addr flush dev eth0
```

---

#### **üí° `ip` vs. `ifconfig` Cheat Sheet**
| Task | `ifconfig` Command | `ip` Command |

# **`ping` Command in Linux**  

The `ping` command is used in Linux to **test network connectivity** between your computer and another device (server, router, or another computer). It helps check if a **host is reachable** and measures the **response time** (latency) of the connection.  

---

## **üìù Syntax**
```sh
ping [OPTIONS] DESTINATION
```
- `DESTINATION` ‚Üí The hostname or IP address you want to check.  

---

## **üìå 1. Basic Usage**  
To check if a host (e.g., `google.com`) is reachable:  
```sh
ping google.com
```
or using an IP address:
```sh
ping 8.8.8.8
```
**Example Output:**
```
PING google.com (142.250.180.14) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 142.250.180.14: icmp_seq=1 ttl=116 time=12.3 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.180.14: icmp_seq=2 ttl=116 time=11.9 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.180.14: icmp_seq=3 ttl=116 time=12.5 ms
```
- `icmp_seq` ‚Üí Packet sequence number.  
- `ttl` (Time-to-Live) ‚Üí Maximum hops before the packet is discarded.  
- `time` ‚Üí Response time in milliseconds (ms).  

### **Stop `ping` Command**
The `ping` command runs **indefinitely** by default. Stop it with:  
```sh
Ctrl + C
```

---

## **üîπ 2. Useful `ping` Command Options**  

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-c COUNT` | Stop after sending COUNT packets |
| `-i INTERVAL` | Set interval (in seconds) between pings |
| `-s SIZE` | Set packet size (default is 56 bytes) |
| `-W TIMEOUT` | Set timeout in seconds for a response |
| `-q` | Quiet mode (only summary output) |
| `-4` | Force IPv4 |
| `-6` | Force IPv6 |

#### **1. Send a Limited Number of Packets (`-c`)**
To send **4 packets** and then stop:  
```sh
ping -c 4 google.com
```
**Example Output:**
```
PING google.com (142.250.180.14): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 142.250.180.14: icmp_seq=1 ttl=116 time=12.1 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.180.14: icmp_seq=2 ttl=116 time=11.8 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.180.14: icmp_seq=3 ttl=116 time=12.0 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.180.14: icmp_seq=4 ttl=116 time=12.2 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 4003ms
```

---

#### **2. Set the Time Interval Between Packets (`-i`)**  
By default, `ping` sends a packet **every second**. To send a packet **every 2 seconds**:  
```sh
ping -i 2 google.com
```

---

#### **3. Change Packet Size (`-s`)**  
To send **100-byte** packets instead of the default 56 bytes:  
```sh
ping -s 100 google.com
```
This is useful for **testing network performance** with different packet sizes.

---

#### **4. Set a Timeout for Response (`-W`)**  
To wait **only 2 seconds** for a response before timing out:  
```sh
ping -W 2 google.com
```

---

#### **5. Quiet Mode (`-q`)**  
To display only summary results and **suppress** detailed output:  
```sh
ping -c 5 -q google.com
```
**Example Output:**
```
--- google.com ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 5002ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 11.805/12.057/12.312/0.184 ms
```
Useful for scripts and logging.

---

#### **6. Force IPv4 (`-4`) or IPv6 (`-6`)**  
Force `ping` to use **IPv4**:  
```sh
ping -4 google.com
```
Force `ping` to use **IPv6**:  
```sh
ping -6 google.com
```

---

#### **üîÑ 3. Understanding `ping` Output**
```
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=118 time=5.32 ms
```
| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `64 bytes` | Packet size received |
| `from 8.8.8.8` | Response came from this IP |
| `icmp_seq=1` | Packet sequence number |
| `ttl=118` | Number of hops before the packet is discarded |
| `time=5.32 ms` | Response time (latency) |

---

#### **üöÄ 4. Use Cases of `ping`**
#### ‚úÖ **1. Check if a Host is Online**
```sh
ping -c 3 google.com
```
If there's **no response**, the host may be **offline** or **blocked**.

#### ‚úÖ **2. Check Network Latency (Ping Time)**
```sh
ping google.com
```
A high `time` value (e.g., `300 ms`) means a **slow connection**.

#### ‚úÖ **3. Test Internet Connection**
If your internet isn‚Äôt working, try:  
```sh
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
```
- If it **works**, your **internet is fine, but DNS might be down**.  
- If it **fails**, your **internet is likely disconnected**.

#### ‚úÖ **4. Test Local Network Connection**
Check if your router (`192.168.1.1`) is reachable:  
```sh
ping -c 3 192.168.1.1
```

#### ‚úÖ **5. Test a Specific Port (Using `ping` Alternative)**
Since `ping` works with **ICMP** (not TCP/UDP), use `nc` or `telnet` to test a **specific port**:
```sh
nc -zv google.com 80
```
This tests if **port 80 (HTTP) is open**.

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è When `ping` Fails**
If `ping` fails, possible reasons include:
1. **Host is down** (server is offline).  
2. **Firewall is blocking ICMP requests**.  
3. **Network issues** (wrong IP, disconnected cable, Wi-Fi issues).  
4. **No internet access** (check router settings).  

---

## **üîö Conclusion**
The `ping` command is an **essential tool** for **troubleshooting network issues** in Linux.  
### **üìå Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Use `ping google.com` to check internet connectivity.**  
‚úÖ **Use `ping -c 5` to limit the number of packets sent.**  
‚úÖ **Use `ping -q` for quiet mode (summary only).**  
‚úÖ **Use `ping -4` or `ping -6` to force IPv4/IPv6.**  
‚úÖ **If `ping` fails, check firewall, internet connection, or DNS issues.**  

---

## **`netstat` Command in Linux (Network Statistics)**  

The `netstat` command in Linux is used to **display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships**. It helps in **monitoring network traffic** and **troubleshooting connectivity issues**.

---

### **üìù Syntax**
```sh
netstat [OPTIONS]
```
- **By default, running `netstat` without options** shows active connections.

---

### **üîπ 1. Common `netstat` Options**  

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a` | Show all connections (listening + non-listening) |
| `-t` | Show **TCP** connections only |
| `-u` | Show **UDP** connections only |
| `-l` | Show **listening** ports only |
| `-p` | Show process **PID** and program using the connection |
| `-n` | Show numerical addresses (no DNS resolution) |
| `-r` | Show **routing table** (similar to `route -n`) |
| `-i` | Show **network interfaces** |
| `-s` | Show **network statistics** for TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP |

---

### **üìå 2. Checking Active Network Connections**
```sh
netstat
```
or  
```sh
netstat -a
```
This lists **all active** TCP and UDP connections.

**Example Output:**
```

udp        0      0 192.168.1.100:68  192.168.1.1:67   ESTABLISHED  
```
- `Proto` ‚Üí Protocol (TCP/UDP)  
- `Local Address` ‚Üí Host‚Äôs IP and port  
- `Foreign Address` ‚Üí Remote server‚Äôs IP and port  
- `State` ‚Üí Connection state (`ESTABLISHED`, `LISTEN`, `CLOSE_WAIT`, etc.)

---

### **üîπ 3. Show Only TCP or UDP Connections**
#### **Show Only TCP Connections**
```sh
netstat -t
```
#### **Show Only UDP Connections**
```sh
netstat -u
```

---

### **üîπ 4. Show Only Listening Ports**
```sh
netstat -l
```
To show **only listening TCP ports**:
```sh
netstat -lt
```
To show **only listening UDP ports**:
```sh
netstat -lu
```

---

### **üîπ 5. Show Process ID (PID) and Program Using the Port**
```sh
netstat -tp
```
This helps in **identifying which process is using a specific port**.

**Example Output:**
```
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address  Foreign Address  State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22     0.0.0.0:*        LISTEN      1023/sshd
```
- `1023/sshd` means **process ID 1023** (sshd service) is listening on port 22.

---

### **üîπ 6. Show Network Routing Table**
```sh
netstat -r
```
or  
```sh
route -n
```
**Example Output:**
```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination   Gateway       Genmask        Flags Iface

eth0    1500  12345   0     6789   0
lo      65536 4567    0     4567   0
```
- `eth0` ‚Üí Main network interface.  
- `lo` ‚Üí Loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`).  

---

### **üîπ 8. Show Network Statistics for TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP**
```sh
netstat -s
```
**Example Output:**
```
Tcp:
    123 active connections openings
    45 failed connection attempts
    678 segments sent
    456 segments received
```
This is useful for **troubleshooting network issues**.

---

### **üîπ 9. Show Numerical IPs and Ports (Disable DNS Resolution)**
```sh
netstat -an
```
- This speeds up results by **preventing DNS lookups**.  
- Instead of `google.com:80`, it shows `142.250.180.14:80`.

---

### **üîπ 10. Find Open Ports on Your System**
To check which ports are **open** and **listening**:  
```sh
netstat -tuln
```
**Example Output:**
```
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address    Foreign Address State  
tcp    0      0     0.0.0.0:22       0.0.0.0:*       LISTEN
tcp    0      0     127.0.0.1:3306   0.0.0.0:*       LISTEN
udp    0      0     192.168.1.100:68 0.0.0.0:*       LISTEN
```
- Port **22** (SSH) is open.  
- Port **3306** (MySQL) is open but **only for local connections**.  

---

### **üîπ 11. Monitor Network Connections in Real Time**
To continuously monitor connections:  
```sh
watch netstat -an
```

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è `netstat` is Deprecated! Use `ss` Instead**
`netstat` is **deprecated** in modern Linux distributions. Instead, use the `ss` command, which is faster and provides similar functionality:

| Task | `netstat` Command | `ss` Command |
|------|--------------------|-------------|
| Show all connections | `netstat -a` | `ss -a` |
| Show listening ports | `netstat -l` | `ss -l` |
| Show TCP connections | `netstat -t` | `ss -t` |
| Show UDP connections | `netstat -u` | `ss -u` |
| Show process IDs | `netstat -tp` | `ss -tp` |

Example:  
```sh
ss -tuln
```
(Same as `netstat -tuln`, but **faster**)

---

## **üéØ Conclusion**
The `netstat` command is a **powerful tool** for monitoring network connections and diagnosing issues. However, it is **deprecated** and replaced by `ss`.

### **üìå Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Use `netstat -tuln` to check open ports.**  
‚úÖ **Use `netstat -p` to see which processes are using ports.**  
‚úÖ **Use `netstat -r` to check routing tables.**  
‚úÖ **Use `netstat -i` to view network interface statistics.**  
‚úÖ **Use `ss` instead of `netstat` for faster results.**  

üöÄ **Master `netstat` to troubleshoot network issues like a pro!**

# **`nslookup` Command in Linux**  

The `nslookup` (Name Server Lookup) command is used in Linux to **query Domain Name System (DNS) records**. It helps in **finding IP addresses of domain names, checking DNS records, and troubleshooting network issues**.

---

## **üìù Syntax**
```sh
nslookup [OPTIONS] [DOMAIN or IP]
```
- If **no domain or IP is specified**, `nslookup` enters **interactive mode**.  
- If a **domain is given**, it returns the **IP address**.  
- If an **IP address is given**, it tries to find the **associated domain name** (Reverse DNS lookup).  

---

## **üîπ 1. Basic Usage: Find IP Address of a Domain**
```sh
nslookup google.com
```
**Example Output:**
```
Server:   8.8.8.8
Address:  8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    google.com
Address: 142.250.180.14
```
- **Name:** The domain name (`google.com`).  
- **Address:** The IP address (`142.250.180.14`).  
- **Server:** The DNS server used (Google‚Äôs `8.8.8.8` in this case).  

---

## **üîπ 2. Reverse DNS Lookup (Find Domain from IP)**
```sh
nslookup 8.8.8.8
```
**Example Output:**
```
Server:   8.8.8.8
Address:  8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
8.8.8.8.in-addr.arpa  name = dns.google.
```
This finds the **hostname** associated with an IP (`dns.google` for `8.8.8.8`).

---

## **üîπ 3. Use a Specific DNS Server**
By default, `nslookup` uses the system-configured DNS server. To use a specific **DNS server**:
```sh
nslookup google.com 1.1.1.1
```
Here, Cloudflare‚Äôs **1.1.1.1** is used as the DNS server.

---

## **üîπ 4. Get More DNS Information**
Use `-debug` to get detailed output:
```sh
nslookup -debug google.com
```

---

## **üîπ 5. Query Specific DNS Record Types**
| Record Type | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| `A` | IPv4 Address Record |
| `AAAA` | IPv6 Address Record |
| `MX` | Mail Exchange (Mail Server) Record |
| `NS` | Name Server Record |
| `CNAME` | Canonical Name (Alias) Record |
| `TXT` | Text Record (Used for SPF, DKIM, etc.) |

### **Example: Get MX Records (Mail Server)**
```sh
nslookup -query=MX gmail.com
```
**Example Output:**
```
Non-authoritative answer:
gmail.com mail exchanger = 40 alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com mail exchanger = 20 alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
```
This shows the **mail servers** for Gmail.

### **Example: Get Name Servers (NS Records)**
```sh
nslookup -query=NS google.com
```

---

## **üîπ 6. Enter Interactive Mode**
Run `nslookup` without arguments:
```sh

# **`route` Command in Linux (Routing Table)**

The `route` command in Linux is used to display and modify the **IP routing table** in a network. The routing table determines how data packets are forwarded between devices on a network. The `route` command allows you to **view** and **manage** the paths that network traffic follows to reach its destination.

---

## **üìù Syntax**
```sh
route [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

### **Basic Usage**
- To view the routing table:
  ```sh
  route
  ```
- To view the routing table with numerical addresses:
  ```sh
  route -n
  ```

---

## **üîπ 1. View the Routing Table**
The `route` command, when run without any options, displays the **current routing table**.  
```sh
route
```
or  
```sh
route -n
```

**Example Output:**
```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
```
- **Destination**: The destination network or IP address.  
- **Gateway**: The next hop (router) address for the destination.  
- **Genmask**: The subnet mask.  
- **Flags**: Information about the route (e.g., `U` = Up, `G` = Gateway).  
- **Metric**: The route's "cost" (lower is better).  
- **Iface**: The network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).

---

## **üîπ 2. Add a New Route**
To add a **new route** to the routing table, use the following syntax:
```sh
route add -net [destination_network] netmask [subnet_mask] gw [gateway]
```
**Example**: Add a route for `192.168.2.0/24` through gateway `192.168.1.1`:
```sh
route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1
```

To add a **default route** (for Internet access), use:
```sh
route add default gw [gateway_ip]
```
**Example**:
```sh
route add default gw 192.168.1.1
```

---

## **üîπ 3. Delete a Route**
To **delete a route**, use the following command:
```sh
route del [destination_network]
```
**Example**: Remove the route to `192.168.2.0/24`:
```sh
route del -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

---

## **üîπ 4. Change the Metric of a Route**
To change the **metric** (cost) of an existing route:
```sh
route change -net [destination_network] netmask [subnet_mask] gw [gateway] metric [new_metric]
```
**Example**: Change the metric of the route to `192.168.2.0/24`:
```sh
route change -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1 metric 10
```

---

## **üîπ 5. Display the Routing Table with `-n` Option (Numerical IPs)**
The `-n` option shows **numerical IP addresses** instead of resolving hostnames or network names.
```sh
route -n
```

**Example Output:**
```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
```

---

## **üîπ 6. Display the Routing Table in Detail**

This will show additional information like the **interface status**.

---

## **üîπ 7. View the Routing Table for Specific Interface**
To view the routes associated with a specific interface:
```sh
route -A [address_family] -I [interface]
```
- **address_family**: `inet` (IPv4) or `inet6` (IPv6).  
- **interface**: The name of the network interface, such as `eth0`, `wlan0`, etc.

**Example**:
```sh
route -A inet -I eth0
```

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Warning for `route` Command**
The `route` command has been **deprecated** in some modern Linux distributions. It‚Äôs recommended to use the **`ip`** command to manage routing tables.

For example, to show the routing table with `ip`:
```sh
ip route show
```

To add a new route with `ip`:
```sh
ip route add [destination_network] via [gateway]
```

---

## **üéØ Conclusion**
The `route` command is useful for **viewing and modifying** the **IP routing table** in Linux. It helps in **routing configuration and troubleshooting network issues**.

### **üìå Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Use `route` to view the routing table**.  
‚úÖ **Use `route add` to add a route**.  
‚úÖ **Use `route del` to remove a route**.  
‚úÖ **Use `route -n` to view routes with numerical IPs**.  
‚úÖ **Use `ip` command as the modern alternative**.

üöÄ **Master the `route` command to manage network routes like a pro!**

# **`host` Command in Linux**

The `host` command in Linux is a **simple utility** used to perform **DNS lookups**. It is used for resolving domain names to IP addresses, querying different DNS record types (such as MX, NS, etc.), and obtaining information about DNS servers.

---

## **üìù Syntax**
```sh
host [OPTIONS] [DOMAIN]
```

- **DOMAIN**: The domain name you want to query.
- **OPTIONS**: Various options to specify the type of DNS record or how the query should be processed.

---

## **üîπ 1. Basic Usage: Find IP Address of a Domain**
The most common usage of the `host` command is to **resolve a domain name to its IP address**.

```sh
host google.com
```

**Example Output:**
```
google.com has address 142.250.180.14
google.com has IPv6 address 2a00:1450:4001:807::200e
```
This command resolves `google.com` to:
- **IPv4 Address**: `142.250.180.14`
- **IPv6 Address**: `2a00:1450:4001:807::200e`

---

## **üîπ 2. Query Specific DNS Record Types**
You can specify the type of DNS record you want to look up. Common record types include:
- **A** (IPv4 address)
- **AAAA** (IPv6 address)
- **MX** (Mail Exchange)
- **NS** (Name Server)
- **CNAME** (Canonical Name)

### **Example: Get the MX (Mail Exchange) Records**
```sh
host -t MX gmail.com
```

**Example Output:**
```
gmail.com mail is handled by 1 aspmx.l.google.com.
gmail.com mail is handled by 5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
```
This shows the **mail servers** for Gmail.

### **Example: Get the NS (Name Server) Records**
```sh
host -t NS google.com
```

**Example Output:**
```
google.com name server ns1.google.com.
google.com name server ns2.google.com.
```
This shows the **name servers** for `google.com`.

### **Example: Get the CNAME (Canonical Name) Record**
```sh
host -t CNAME www.example.com
```
This would return the **canonical name** for `www.example.com`, if applicable.

---

## **üîπ 3. Reverse DNS Lookup (Find Domain from IP Address)**
You can use the `host` command for **reverse DNS lookups** (finding the domain associated with an IP address).

```sh
host 8.8.8.8
```

**Example Output:**
```
8.8.8.8.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer dns.google.
```
This shows that the **reverse DNS** for `8.8.8.8` is `dns.google`.

---

## **üîπ 4. Query a Specific DNS Server**
By default, `host` queries the DNS server configured on your system. You can specify a different DNS server for the query by adding the DNS server's IP address after the domain.

```sh
host google.com 8.8.8.8
```

This queries `google.com` using Google's public DNS server `8.8.8.8`.

---

## **üîπ 5. Use Verbose Output**
The `-v` option enables **verbose output**, providing more detailed information about the DNS query.

```sh
host -v google.com
```

**Example Output:**
```
Trying "google.com"
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 57450
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 4, ADDITIONAL: 3
...
google.com has address 142.250.180.14
```
This shows additional details, such as query status and response data.

---

## **üîπ 6. Specify a Different Query Type**
By default, the `host` command queries for **A records** (IPv4 addresses). To specify a different record type, use the `-t` option.

### **Example: Query for AAAA Records (IPv6 Address)**
```sh
host -t AAAA google.com
```

**Example Output:**
```
google.com has IPv6 address 2a00:1450:4001:807::200e
```

---

## **üîπ 7. Query the DNS for a Specific Port**
The `-p` option allows querying for a specific **port** for the DNS query.

```sh
host -p 53 google.com
```

This would send the query to port `53` (default DNS port).

---

## **üîπ 8. Check the DNS TTL (Time to Live)**
The TTL (Time to Live) is the time a DNS record is cached by the resolver. To view the TTL value, simply use the `host` command and look for the time value.

```sh
host google.com
```

**Example Output:**
```
google.com has address 142.250.180.14
```
The TTL will typically be shown in the response, indicating how long the result will be cached.

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è `host` Command Alternatives**
While `host` is a convenient tool, there are other commands that can also be used for DNS lookups, such as:

- **`nslookup`**: A more detailed and interactive DNS lookup tool.
- **`dig`**: A powerful DNS query tool with more advanced features and greater control over the query process.

---

## **üéØ Conclusion**
The `host` command is a simple, easy-to-use tool for performing DNS lookups, reverse lookups, and querying different DNS record types. It‚Äôs a great tool for network administrators and anyone who needs to troubleshoot or gather DNS-related information.

### **üìå Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Use `host google.com` to find an IP address for a domain.**  
‚úÖ **Use `host -t MX domain.com` to check mail exchange servers.**  
‚úÖ **Use `host -t NS domain.com` to query name servers.**  
‚úÖ **Use `host 8.8.8.8` for reverse DNS lookup (find the domain from an IP).**  
‚úÖ **Use `host -v` for verbose output and more details.**

üöÄ **Master the `host` command to troubleshoot DNS and network issues efficiently!**

# **`hostname` Command in Linux**

The `hostname` command in Linux is used to display or set the **system's hostname** (the name assigned to the machine) and manage the network hostname. It allows you to **view** or **change** the system‚Äôs hostname for network identification purposes.

---

## **üìù Syntax**
```sh
hostname [OPTION] [HOSTNAME]
```

- **HOSTNAME**: The name you want to set for the system (optional when just displaying).
- **OPTION**: Various flags to modify the behavior of the command.

---

## **üîπ 1. Display the Current Hostname**
To simply display the current **hostname** of your system, use the command without any arguments:
```sh
hostname
```

**Example Output:**
```
myserver
```
This shows that the current hostname is **`myserver`**.

---

## **üîπ 2. Set the Hostname Temporarily**
To change the **hostname temporarily** (it will revert after a reboot), use:
```sh
hostname newhostname
```
**Example:**
```sh
hostname mynewserver
```
This will change the hostname to **`mynewserver`** for the current session. The change will not persist after a reboot unless additional configuration is done.

---

## **üîπ 3. Set the Hostname Permanently**
To change the **hostname permanently**, you must edit system files and restart the machine or the networking service. The specific files vary based on the distribution.

### **For most Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)**:
1. Change the hostname in the **`/etc/hostname`** file:
   - Open the file in an editor:
     ```sh
     sudo nano /etc/hostname
     ```
   - Replace the existing hostname with the new one and save.

2. Also, edit the **`/etc/hosts`** file to ensure the new hostname is correctly mapped:
   - Open the file:
     ```sh
     sudo nano /etc/hosts
     ```
   - Modify the line that contains the old hostname, e.g.:
     ```
     127.0.0.1   localhost mynewserver
     ```

3. After editing these files, restart the system or the networking service to apply the changes:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-hostnamed
   ```

---

## **üîπ 4. Display the Hostname in Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Format**
If you want to display the hostname along with its **domain** (Fully Qualified Domain Name), use:
```sh
hostname -f
```

**Example Output:**
```
mynewserver.example.com
```
This shows the **FQDN**, which includes the hostname and domain.

---

## **üîπ 5. Display the Hostname with Additional Information**
To show more detailed information, including the **IP address** of the system associated with the hostname, use:
```sh
hostname -I
```

**Example Output:**
```
192.168.1.10
```
This shows the **IP address** associated with the system.

---

## **üîπ 6. View the Kernel‚Äôs Hostname (System Name)**
The `-s` option shows only the **short hostname** (without the domain):
```sh
hostname -s
```

**Example Output:**
```
mynewserver
```

This shows just the **hostname**, not the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

---

## **üîπ 7. Display the System‚Äôs DNS Domain**
To display the **domain** of the system (excluding the hostname), use:
```sh
hostname -d
```

**Example Output:**
```
example.com
```
This shows the **domain name** that the system is associated with, if configured.

---

## **üîπ 8. Set the Hostname Temporarily Using `/etc/hostname` (Modern Systems)**

On **modern Linux systems** using **`systemd`**, you can also change the hostname temporarily using the following command:
```sh
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newhostname
```

**Example:**
```sh
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname mynewserver
```
This command will update the system's hostname in a **persistent** manner, and the change will remain even after a reboot.

To view the current hostname and other system details, use:
```sh
hostnamectl
```

**Example Output:**
```
Static hostname: mynewserver
Icon name: computer-vm
Chassis: vm
Machine ID: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
Boot ID: abcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Kernel: Linux 5.8.0-53-generic
Architecture: x86-64
```

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**
1. **Temporary Changes**: Using `hostname` without editing system files will only change the hostname for the current session.
2. **Permanent Changes**: Use the `hostnamectl` or modify the **`/etc/hostname`** and **`/etc/hosts`** files to make changes persistent.
3. **Systemd Systems**: On systems using **`systemd`** (e.g., Ubuntu 16.04 and later), `hostnamectl` is recommended for hostname management.

---

## **üéØ Conclusion**
The `hostname` command is a versatile tool for managing the **hostname** of your Linux system. You can use it to **view**, **set**, or **change** the hostname temporarily or permanently, as well as to gather **network-related information**.

### **üìå Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Use `hostname` to display the current hostname.**  
‚úÖ **Use `hostname newhostname` to temporarily set a new hostname.**  
‚úÖ **Use `hostnamectl set-hostname` for a permanent hostname change on systemd-based systems.**  
‚úÖ **Use `hostname -f` to display the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).**  
‚úÖ **Use `hostname -I` to view the system‚Äôs IP address.**

üöÄ **Master the `hostname` command for efficient system identification and management!**


# **`whois` Command in Linux**

The `whois` command in Linux is a utility used to **query WHOIS databases** and retrieve information about a domain name, IP address, or network. It provides information about domain registration, such as the **owner**, **registrar**, **registration dates**, and **contact information**.

---

## **üìù Syntax**
```sh
whois [OPTIONS] [DOMAIN or IP]
```
- **DOMAIN or IP**: The domain name or IP address you want to query.
- **OPTIONS**: Various flags that modify how the query is performed.

---

## **üîπ 1. Basic Usage: Query Information About a Domain**
To perform a basic WHOIS lookup on a domain, simply type:
```sh
whois example.com
```

**Example Output:**
```
Domain Name: EXAMPLE.COM
Registry Domain ID: 2336797_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN
Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.verisign-grs.com
Registrar URL: http://www.verisign.com

...
```
This shows details such as:
- **Domain Name**: `example.com`
- **Registrar**: The company managing the domain registration.
- **Creation Date**: When the domain was first registered.
- **Expiration Date**: When the domain registration will expire.
- **Status**: Current status of the domain (e.g., active, deleted, or locked).

---

## **üîπ 2. WHOIS Lookup for an IP Address**
You can also use `whois` to query an **IP address** to get information about the **owner** and **network** it belongs to.

```sh
whois 8.8.8.8
```

**Example Output:**
```
NetRange:       8.8.8.0 - 8.8.8.255
CIDR:           8.8.8.0/24
NetName:        GOOGLE
Organization:   Google LLC
Address:        1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
                Mountain View, CA 94043
```
This will return details about the IP range, associated organization (e.g., Google), and contact information.

---

## **üîπ 3. Query WHOIS Data for Multiple Domains**
To query multiple domains, you can specify each domain in sequence:
```sh
whois example1.com example2.org example3.net
```

This will perform WHOIS lookups for all the listed domains.

---

## **üîπ 4. Display Specific WHOIS Information**
By default, the `whois` command will display a lot of information. If you're only interested in a specific piece of data, you can use tools like `grep` to filter the output. For example, to find the **expiration date** of a domain:
```sh
whois example.com | grep 'Expiration Date'
```

**Example Output:**
```
Expiration Date: 2023-05-14T04:00:00Z
```

---

## **üîπ 5. Use Options to Modify WHOIS Output**
There are several useful options that allow you to modify the behavior of the `whois` command:

- **`-H`**: Hide output that contains information such as the registrar's WHOIS server or the registrar‚Äôs details.
  ```sh
  whois -H example.com
  ```

- **`-i`**: Perform a WHOIS lookup on a domain or IP address in a specific country.
  ```sh
  whois -i 8.8.8.8
  ```

- **`-h`**: Specify a different WHOIS server to query.
  ```sh
  whois -h whois.iana.org example.com
  ```

- **`-p`**: Specify a port to connect to for the WHOIS query (default is 43).
  ```sh
  whois -p 43 example.com
  ```

---

## **üîπ 6. WhoIs Database Variations**
Different domain registrars and organizations maintain their own WHOIS databases, and each may provide different levels of detail. Some domain types (like **.com**, **.org**, or **.net**) may have publicly available information, while others (like **.io** or **.co**) may have limited details due to privacy laws and restrictions.

For certain domains, you may see a **Privacy Protection** notice, indicating that the registrant‚Äôs contact details are hidden for privacy reasons.

---

## **üîπ 7. WHOIS Data Privacy**
The amount of information you can retrieve using `whois` depends on the domain registrar's policies and the specific **ICANN** (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) rules. For example, many domains now offer **privacy protection services**, where personal contact details are obfuscated or hidden.

If you query a domain that has **WHOIS privacy** enabled, you may see something like this:

**Example Output for WHOIS Privacy:**
```
Registrant Name: Redacted for Privacy
Registrant Organization: Redacted for Privacy
```

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è WHOIS Command Limits and Restrictions**
- Some WHOIS servers may have rate-limiting or restrictions to prevent abuse. If you run too many queries in a short period, you may receive an error or be temporarily blocked.
- Some domain registrars do not offer full WHOIS information, especially for private or restricted domains.

---

## **üéØ Conclusion**
The `whois` command is a powerful tool for querying **domain registration** and **IP address** information. It's useful for finding ownership, registrar details, registration and expiration dates, and contact information about websites or networks. It's an essential tool for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone investigating domain ownership or performing network diagnostics.

### **üìå Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Use `whois domain.com` to get domain registration details.**  
‚úÖ **Use `whois 8.8.8.8` for information about an IP address.**  
‚úÖ **Filter results using `grep` for specific data, like expiration dates.**  
‚úÖ **Use options like `-H`, `-i`, and `-h` to modify the output.**

üöÄ **Leverage the `whois` command for fast and detailed domain/IP lookups!**

## **`curl` & `wget` Commands in Linux**

```sh
curl https://api.example.com/data
```
This makes a **GET** request to the specified URL and displays the response in the terminal.

#### 4. Make a POST Request with Data
```sh
curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=secret" https://example.com/login
```
This sends a **POST** request with data (`username` and `password`) to the specified URL.

#### 5. Add Custom Headers
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://api.example.com/data
```
This sends a GET request with a custom **Authorization header**.

#### 6. Follow Redirects
```sh
curl -L https://example.com
```
This follows HTTP redirects (useful when a URL is redirected to another URL).

## **2. `wget` Command: Overview**

`wget` is another **command-line utility** used to **download files** from the web. It is specifically designed for **non-interactive** downloads, meaning it can run in the background without requiring user input. `wget` is more focused on file retrieval, and it does not offer as much flexibility in terms of interacting with APIs or sending data.

### **üìù Syntax**
```sh
wget [OPTIONS] [URL]
```

### **üîπ Key Features of `wget`:**
- **Designed for downloading files**: `wget` excels at downloading files, including the ability to recursively download entire websites.
- **Automatic retries**: It can automatically retry if the download fails.
- **Resumes downloads**: If a download is interrupted, you can resume it with `wget` using the `-c` flag.
- **Supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP**: Like `curl`, it supports major protocols, but its focus is on file retrieval.

### **üîπ Basic Usage of `wget`**

#### 1. Download a Single File
```sh
wget https://example.com/file.txt
```
This downloads the file `file.txt` from the specified URL and saves it locally.

#### 2. Download a File with a Different Name
```sh
wget -O newfile.txt https://example.com/file.txt
```
This downloads the file and saves it with the name `newfile.txt`.

#### 3. Download a File in the Background
```sh
wget -b https://example.com/file.txt
```
This downloads the file in the background (useful for large files).

#### 4. Resume a Download
If the download was interrupted, use the `-c` flag to resume:
```sh
wget -c https://example.com/largefile.iso
```
This resumes the download from where it left off.

#### 5. Download All Files from a Website (Recursive Download)
```sh
wget -r https://example.com
```
This recursively downloads all files from the specified website (use with caution, as it can grab a lot of content).

#### 6. Limit Download Speed
```sh
wget --limit-rate=200k https://example.com/file.iso
```
This limits the download speed to **200 KB/s**.

| Feature                        | `curl`                                   | `wget`                                  |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | File transfer and API interaction        | Downloading files                       |
| **Protocol Support**            | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, SCP, LDAP, etc. | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP                        |
| **Follow Redirects**            | Supports with `-L` option                | Automatically follows redirects         |
| **Resuming Downloads**          | Not natively supported                   | Supports with `-c` option               |
| **Custom Headers**              | Supports custom headers with `-H`        | Does not support custom headers         |
| **Background Download**         | Not supported natively                  | Supports with `-b` flag                 |
| **Recursive Download**          | Not supported                            | Supports with `-r` option               |
| **Interactivity**               | Can interact with APIs and servers       | Non-interactive (perfect for background use) |

### **4. Choosing Between `curl` and `wget`**

- **Use `curl` when:**
  - You need to **interact with APIs** or perform HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
  - You need to **send data** (e.g., for API authentication or form submissions).
  - You need to make requests with **custom headers**.
  - You need to **download a single file** or interact with URLs in a more flexible way.

- **Use `wget` when:**
  - You need to **download large files** or entire directories.
  - You need to **resume interrupted downloads**.
  - You want a **non-interactive downloader** that works in the background.
  - You need to **download recursively** from a website.

#### **üéØ Conclusion**

Both `curl` and `wget` are powerful tools for downloading content from the web, but they serve different purposes:
- **`curl`** is a versatile tool for both **data transfer** and **API interaction**, offering a wide range of features beyond simple file downloading.
- **`wget`** is a specialized tool focused on **downloading files** efficiently, including features like recursive downloads and resuming interrupted downloads.

### **üìå Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Use `curl` for file transfers, APIs, and custom HTTP requests.**  
‚úÖ **Use `wget` for non-interactive file downloads, large files, and recursive downloads.**  
‚úÖ **Choose `curl` for flexibility, and `wget` for simplicity and background downloading.**
