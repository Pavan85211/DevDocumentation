Q1: Can you explain your experience with AWS and DevOps practices?
A: I have extensive experience working in AWS cloud environments and implementing DevOps practices. My expertise includes setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitLab and Jenkins, managing infrastructure with Terraform, and containerizing applications using Docker and Kubernetes. I have also worked with AWS services like EC2, EKS, S3, VPC, Route 53, ELB, and CloudWatch for application development and monitoring.

Q2: What is your experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
A: I have hands-on experience with Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. I have written Terraform modules for AWS services, including VPC, EC2, EKS, and IAM roles, ensuring infrastructure is scalable and repeatable. I have also worked with Ansible for configuration management and automation of deployments across multiple environments.

Q3: How do you ensure high availability and scalability of applications in Kubernetes?
A: I ensure high availability using AWS EKS with Kubernetes auto-scaling features, such as Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). I also implement load balancing using Kubernetes Services and AWS ALB to distribute traffic effectively. To maintain resilience, I use rolling updates and self-healing features such as liveness and readiness probes.

CI/CD and Automation
Q4: Can you describe a CI/CD pipeline you implemented using GitLab/Jenkins?
A: I have implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins. In GitLab, I configured .gitlab-ci.yml files to define build, test, and deployment stages running in Docker containers. I used GitLab Runners for executing jobs and integrated Docker Hub for managing containerized applications. In Jenkins, I configured pipeline scripts for automating builds, testing, and deployments across multiple environments.

Q5: How do you manage secrets and sensitive data in your CI/CD pipelines?
A: I use AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault to securely store sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, and certificates. For GitLab and Jenkins, I configure environment variables and encrypted credentials to avoid hardcoding secrets in repositories.

Containerization and Orchestration
Q6: How do you manage Docker images and ensure proper versioning?
A: I use Docker Hub and AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store and manage Docker images. I follow versioning best practices by tagging images with meaningful identifiers like v1.0.0, latest, and commit hashes to ensure proper traceability.

Q7: What are some challenges you've faced while working with Kubernetes, and how did you resolve them?
A: One challenge was debugging failing Kubernetes pods due to misconfigured networking. I used kubectl logs and kubectl describe pod to analyze errors. Another issue was managing persistent storage, which I resolved by configuring AWS EBS Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for stateful applications.

Monitoring and Logging
Q8: What monitoring tools have you used, and how do you set up monitoring for your infrastructure?
A: I have used Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for visualization. I configure Prometheus exporters to collect data from Kubernetes clusters and set up Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring. Additionally, I use AWS CloudWatch for logging and setting up alerts for key infrastructure components.

Q9: How do you troubleshoot performance issues in a cloud-based environment?
A: I analyze logs using AWS CloudWatch, ELK Stack, or Splunk. I use Prometheus to monitor system metrics like CPU, memory, and network usage. I also profile application performance using APM tools and optimize by tuning autoscaling, load balancing, and caching mechanisms.

Networking and Security
Q10: How do you secure Kubernetes clusters?
A: I implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to manage access permissions, enable network policies to restrict traffic between pods, and use AWS IAM roles for authentication. Additionally, I enable Kubernetes secrets encryption and regularly scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or SonarQube.

Q11: How do you handle DNS and routing in AWS?
A: I use AWS Route 53 for domain management, DNS resolution, and traffic routing. I configure hosted zones, set up alias records for load balancers, and implement failover routing to ensure high availability.

Terraform and Infrastructure as Code
Q12: Can you describe a Terraform project you worked on?
A: I worked on setting up AWS infrastructure using Terraform for an application deployed on EKS. I created Terraform modules for provisioning VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, and IAM roles. I also configured remote state management using AWS S3 with DynamoDB locking for consistency.

Q13: How do you handle Terraform state management in a team environment?
A: I use AWS S3 as a remote backend for storing Terraform state and enable state locking with DynamoDB to prevent conflicts. I also follow best practices like versioning Terraform configurations and using workspaces to manage different environments.
