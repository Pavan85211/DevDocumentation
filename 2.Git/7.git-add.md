## **Git `add` Command Explained**  

### ðŸ”¹ **What is `git add`?**  
`git add` is used to **stage** changes (modified or new files) before committing them. It moves files from the **working directory** to the **staging area** so they can be included in the next commit.  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Basic Workflow in Git**
1. **Modify files** (in the working directory).
2. **Stage files** using `git add` (moves them to the staging area).
3. **Commit the changes** using `git commit`.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Usage Examples of `git add`**

### âœ… **1. Add a Single File**
```sh
git add filename.txt
```
- Stages only `filename.txt` for the next commit.

---

### âœ… **2. Add Multiple Files**
```sh
git add file1.txt file2.txt
```
- Stages `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` together.

---

### âœ… **3. Add All Modified & New Files**
```sh
git add .
```
- Adds **all** changes (new and modified files) in the current directory.  
- **Does not add deleted files**.

---

### âœ… **4. Add All Tracked & Untracked Files (Including Deletions)**
```sh
git add -A
```
- Stages **everything**, including deleted files.  
- Equivalent to:
  ```sh
  git add --all
  ```

---

### âœ… **5. Add Only Modified Files**
```sh
git add -u
```
- Stages **only modified and deleted files** (not new files).

---

### âœ… **6. Add Files in a Specific Directory**
```sh
git add folder_name/
```
- Stages all changes inside `folder_name/`.

---

### âœ… **7. Interactively Select Changes to Add**
```sh
git add -p
```
- Git will show **each change** and ask if you want to stage it.
- Useful when you want to **stage only some parts** of a file.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Checking Staged Files**
To check which files are staged, run:
```sh
git status
```
- Staged files will appear in **green**.
- Unstaged files will appear in **red**.
