### **Git `stash` Command Explained with Examples**  

#### 🔹 **What is `git stash`?**  
`git stash` allows you to **temporarily save changes** that are not ready to be committed. It moves the changes **out of your working directory** and keeps them in a **hidden stash**, so you can switch branches or work on something else without committing them.

---

## **Example Scenario**
### ✅ **Step 1: Modify a File**  
Let’s say you are working on a file called `app.py` but aren’t ready to commit yet.

```sh
echo "print('New feature')" >> app.py
```

Check the status:
```sh
git status
```
Output:
```
Changes not staged for commit:
    modified: app.py
```
You need to switch branches, but you don’t want to commit these changes yet.

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Stash the Changes**  
Run:
```sh
git stash
```
Now, if you check `git status`:
```sh
git status
```
Output:
```
Your working directory is clean.
```
- Your changes have been **saved in the stash** and **removed from the working directory**.

---

### ✅ **Step 3: List Stashes**
You can see all stashed changes using:
```sh
git stash list
```
Output:
```
stash@{0}: WIP on main: 4f8c3d2 Added new feature
```
Each stash is stored as `stash@{n}` where `n` is the index (latest stash is `stash@{0}`).

---

### ✅ **Step 4: Apply Stashed Changes**
To bring back the latest stash:
```sh
git stash apply
```
This applies the changes but **keeps them in the stash**.  
To remove the stash after applying:
```sh
git stash pop
```

---

### ✅ **Step 5: Remove a Specific Stash**
If you want to delete a specific stash:
```sh
git stash drop stash@{0}
```
To **delete all stashes**:
```sh
git stash clear
```

---

## **Advanced Git Stash Options**
### **1️⃣ Stash Only Unstaged Changes**
```sh
git stash -u
```
This stashes **both tracked and untracked** files.

---

### **2️⃣ Stash With a Custom Message**
```sh
git stash push -m "Saving work before switching branch"
```
Now, `git stash list` will show the message.

---

### **3️⃣ Apply a Specific Stash**
```sh
git stash apply stash@{2}
```
Applies the third stash entry.

---

### **4️⃣ Create a Stash Branch**
```sh
git stash branch new-branch stash@{0}
```
Creates a new branch from the stash.

---

## **Difference Between `git stash` and `git reset`**
| Feature            | `git stash` | `git reset` |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Temporarily saves changes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Removes changes from working directory | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Can be reapplied later | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Affects commit history | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (if `--hard`) |

---

## **Conclusion**
- `git stash` is useful when you need to **temporarily save changes** without committing.
- You can **restore changes** later using `git stash pop` or `git stash apply`.
- It’s **safe to use in collaborative environments** since it **does not modify commit history**.
