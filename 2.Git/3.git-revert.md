### **Git `revert` Command Explained with Example**  

#### 🔹 **What is `git revert`?**  
`git revert` is used to **undo a commit** by creating a new commit that **reverses the changes** made by the original commit. Unlike `git reset`, it **preserves the commit history**, making it a safer option for collaborative projects.

---

### **Example Scenario**  

#### ✅ **Step 1: Check Commit History**  
Let’s say you have the following commit history:  
```
A -- B -- C -- D (HEAD, main)
```
Now, you realize that commit `C` introduced a bug, and you want to undo it **without losing the commit history**.

Run:
```sh
git log --oneline
```
Output:
```
4f8c3d2 (HEAD -> main) D
3b6a1f9 C  # Buggy commit
1e7d2b4 B
a3f5d1a A
```

---

#### ✅ **Step 2: Revert Commit `C`**
To undo commit `C`, run:
```sh
git revert 3b6a1f9
```
- Git creates a **new commit** that undoes the changes from `C`.
- The history now looks like this:
```
A -- B -- C -- D -- E (HEAD, main)
```
- `E` is a new commit that reverses `C`.

---

#### ✅ **Step 3: Check the Commit History Again**
Run:
```sh
git log --oneline
```
Output:
```
9c7d5e8 (HEAD -> main) Revert "C"
4f8c3d2 D
3b6a1f9 C
1e7d2b4 B
a3f5d1a A
```
- You’ll see a **new commit** with the message `"Revert C"`.  
- **C is not deleted**, but its changes are undone.

---

### 🔹 **Reverting Multiple Commits**
To revert multiple commits, use:
```sh
git revert <commit-hash-1> <commit-hash-2>
```

OR, for a range of commits:
```sh
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD
```
- This reverts the last two commits (`HEAD~2` to `HEAD`).

---

### 🔹 **Abort Revert (If Needed)**
If you start a `git revert` but want to cancel before committing:
```sh
git revert --abort
```

---

### **Difference Between `git revert` and `git reset`**
| Feature            | `git revert` | `git reset` |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| History Preserved | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (modifies history) |
| Safe for Team Use | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (rewrites history) |
| Creates New Commit | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (unless `--soft`) |
| Deletes Commits | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (with `--hard`) |

Use **`git revert`** when working in a **shared repository** to avoid rewriting commit history.

---

### **Conclusion**
- `git revert` **safely undoes** a commit without deleting history.
- It **creates a new commit** to reverse changes.
- Ideal for **collaborative work**.
