### **Git `cherry-pick` Command Explained with Example**  

#### üîπ **What is `git cherry-pick`?**  
`git cherry-pick` allows you to **selectively apply a specific commit** from one branch to another **without merging the entire branch**.  
It‚Äôs useful when you want to copy only a particular change without bringing other commits along.

---

## **Example Scenario**
Let's say you have two branches:  

```
A -- B -- C -- D (main)
      \
       E -- F -- G (feature)
```

Now, you realize that commit **`F`** contains an important fix that you want in `main`, but you don‚Äôt want `E` and `G`.  

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Find the Commit Hash**
Switch to the `feature` branch and list the commits:
```sh
git log --oneline
```
Output:
```
d4e5f6g G
b2c3d4e F  # Important commit we need
a1b2c3d E
```
Note down the hash of commit `F` (e.g., `b2c3d4e`).

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Switch to the `main` Branch**
```sh
git checkout main
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Cherry-Pick the Commit**
Run:
```sh
git cherry-pick b2c3d4e
```
- This **copies** commit `F` to `main` **without merging `feature`**.
- The commit history now looks like:
```
A -- B -- C -- D -- F (main)
      \
       E -- F -- G (feature)
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Check the New Commit**
Run:
```sh
git log --oneline
```
Output:
```
x1y2z3a F (HEAD -> main)  # Copied commit
4f8c3d2 D
3b6a1f9 C
```
Commit `F` is now **on `main`**.

---

## **Advanced Cherry-Pick Options**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Cherry-Pick Multiple Commits**
If you want to pick multiple commits:
```sh
git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2>
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Cherry-Pick a Range of Commits**
```sh
git cherry-pick C..G
```
- This picks commits **D, E, F, and G** (but not `C`).

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Resolve Conflicts During Cherry-Picking**
If there‚Äôs a conflict, Git will show a message like:
```
error: conflict in <file>
```
- Manually resolve the conflicts.
- Then **continue**:
  ```sh
  git cherry-pick --continue
  ```
- Or, if you want to cancel the cherry-pick:
  ```sh
  git cherry-pick --abort
  ```

---

## **Difference Between `git cherry-pick` and `git merge`**
| Feature            | `git cherry-pick` | `git merge` |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Copies a single commit | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (merges entire branch) |
| Keeps branch history clean | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Can be used across branches | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

---

## **Conclusion**
- `git cherry-pick` is useful when you need **only specific commits** from another branch.  
- It **does not merge** the whole branch, keeping the history cleaner.  
- Be mindful of **merge conflicts** when picking multiple commits.
