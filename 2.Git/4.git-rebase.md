## **Git `rebase` Command Explained**  

### 🔹 **What is `git rebase`?**  
`git rebase` is used to **move or combine commits** from one branch onto another. Instead of creating a merge commit, it **rewrites commit history** by applying changes **one by one** on top of a different branch.

---

## **🔹 Why Use `git rebase`?**
1. **Keeps commit history clean**: No extra merge commits.
2. **Applies latest changes from another branch**.
3. **Works better for feature branches** than `merge`.

---

## **🔹 Example Scenario**

### ✅ **Step 1: Check Your Branch Structure**  
Let's say you have the following branch history:

```
       A -- B -- C (feature-branch)
      /
D -- E -- F -- G (main)
```
- **`main`** has new commits (`F` and `G`).
- You want to update `feature-branch` with these changes.

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Rebase `feature-branch` onto `main`**
First, switch to the feature branch:
```sh
git checkout feature-branch
```
Run:
```sh
git rebase main
```
### **What Happens?**
Git **re-applies** commits (`B` and `C`) **on top of** `main` like this:

```
D -- E -- F -- G -- B' -- C' (feature-branch)
```
- **`B'` and `C'` are new commits** (rewritten versions of `B` and `C`).
- **No merge commit!**

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Push the Rebased Branch**  
If you have already pushed `feature-branch` before rebasing, Git will **reject your push**.  
Fix this using a **force push**:
```sh
git push origin feature-branch --force
```
⚠️ **Warning:** Force-pushing rewrites history, so be careful when working in a team.

---

## **🔹 Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)**
You can **edit, squash, or reorder** commits interactively:
```sh
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```
- Git opens an editor where you can:
  - `pick` → Keep commit as is.
  - `reword` → Edit commit message.
  - `squash` → Merge commits together.
  - `edit` → Modify the commit.

Example:
```
pick 123abc First commit
squash 456def Second commit
reword 789ghi Third commit
```
- This will **combine** the second commit into the first.

---

## **🔹 Difference Between `merge` and `rebase`**
| Feature | `git merge` | `git rebase` |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Commit history | Preserves all commits | Rewrites history |
| Merge commit | ✅ Yes (extra commit) | ❌ No |
| Complexity | Easier | More advanced |
| Use case | When history should be preserved | When a clean history is preferred |

---

## **🔹 Undo a Rebase**
If something goes wrong:
```sh
git rebase --abort  # Stop rebase and restore original state
```
If you've already finished rebasing but want to undo it:
```sh
git reflog
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

---

## **🔹 Summary**
- `git rebase` moves commits **on top of another branch**.
- **Keeps history clean**, unlike `merge`.
- Use `git rebase -i` for **interactive modifications**.
- Be careful with `--force` when pushing after rebasing.
