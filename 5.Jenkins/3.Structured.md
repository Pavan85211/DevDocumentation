### **Pipeline Jobs: Scripted (Groovy-based) Automation of CI/CD Pipelines**  

#### **1. What is a Jenkins Pipeline?**  
A **Jenkins Pipeline** is a collection of Jenkins jobs connected in a sequence to perform **continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)**. It automates building, testing, and deploying applications.  

There are **two types** of pipelines in Jenkins:  
1. **Declarative Pipeline** â€“ Uses a structured Groovy syntax and is easier to write.  
2. **Scripted Pipeline** â€“ Uses full Groovy scripting and provides more flexibility.  

#### **2. What is a Scripted Pipeline?**  
A **Scripted Pipeline** is a traditional way of writing Jenkins pipelines using Groovy scripting. It provides full control over the CI/CD process and is more powerful for advanced automation.

- Written inside the `node {}` block.
- Uses standard Groovy syntax.
- More flexible but complex compared to declarative pipelines.

#### **3. Basic Structure of a Scripted Pipeline**  
A **Scripted Pipeline** follows this structure:

```groovy
node {
    stage('Checkout Code') {
        checkout scm
    }

    stage('Build') {
        try {
            sh 'mvn clean package'
        } catch (Exception e) {
            echo "Build failed: ${e}"
            currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
        }
    }

    stage('Test') {
        try {
            sh 'mvn test'
        } catch (Exception e) {
            echo "Tests failed: ${e}"
            currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
        }
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
        if (currentBuild.result != 'FAILURE') {
            sh 'scp target/myapp.jar user@server:/deployments/'
        }
    }
}
```

### **4. Understanding Scripted Pipeline Components**
#### **a) `node {}`**
- The pipeline runs inside a **node**, which is a Jenkins agent.
- Nodes are machines where Jenkins executes build tasks.

#### **b) `stage('Stage Name') {}`**
- Defines different phases of CI/CD, such as **Build, Test, Deploy**.
- Helps in tracking progress visually in Jenkins.

#### **c) `checkout scm`**
- Pulls the latest code from a source code repository like **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket**.

#### **d) `sh 'command'`**
- Executes shell commands inside the pipeline.
- Example: `sh 'mvn clean package'` runs a Maven build.

#### **e) `try-catch` for Error Handling**
- Used to **catch and handle failures** gracefully.
- Example:
  ```groovy
  try {
      sh 'mvn test'
  } catch (Exception e) {
      echo "Tests failed: ${e}"
      currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
  }
  ```

#### **f) Conditional Deployment**
- Ensures deployment happens **only if the build is successful**.
- Example:
  ```groovy
  if (currentBuild.result != 'FAILURE') {
      sh 'scp target/app.jar user@server:/deployments/'
  }
  ```

### **5. Advanced Scripted Pipeline Example**
#### **Dockerized CI/CD Pipeline**
Hereâ€™s an **advanced Scripted Pipeline** that:
1. **Clones a GitHub repository.**
2. **Builds a Docker image.**
3. **Pushes the image to Docker Hub.**
4. **Deploys to Kubernetes.**

```groovy
node {
    def dockerImage = 'myrepo/myapp:latest'

    stage('Clone Repo') {
        git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
    }

    stage('Build Docker Image') {
        sh "docker build -t ${dockerImage} ."
    }

    stage('Push to Docker Hub') {
        withDockerRegistry([credentialsId: 'docker-hub-cred', url: '']) {
            sh "docker push ${dockerImage}"
        }
    }

    stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
        sh "kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml"
    }
}
```

### **6. When to Use Scripted Pipelines?**
âœ… **Use Scripted Pipelines when:**
- You need **advanced logic** (loops, conditions, dynamic stages).
- You want **fine-grained control** over pipeline execution.
- You need **complex error handling**.
- You are comfortable with **Groovy scripting**.

ðŸš« **Avoid Scripted Pipelines when:**
- The pipeline is **simple** (use Declarative instead).
- You want **readability and maintainability**.

### **7. Key Differences: Scripted vs Declarative Pipelines**
| Feature | Scripted Pipeline | Declarative Pipeline |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| Syntax | Groovy scripting (more flexible) | Simplified Groovy (structured) |
| Complexity | More complex | Easier to read & write |
| Error Handling | Manual (`try-catch`) | Built-in (`post` block) |
| Best Use Case | Advanced automation | Standard CI/CD |
