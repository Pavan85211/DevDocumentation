To set up **Kubernetes monitoring with Prometheus**, you can follow this step-by-step guide. This example covers deploying **Prometheus** in a **Kubernetes cluster**, **scraping metrics**, and **visualizing with Grafana**.

### **Prerequisites:**
1. A running Kubernetes cluster (could be Minikube, GKE, EKS, etc.).
2. `kubectl` configured to access your cluster.
3. Helm (for Kubernetes package management).

---

### **1. Install Prometheus with Helm**
Helm makes it easier to deploy Prometheus and associated components like **Alertmanager** and **Grafana**.

#### **Step 1: Add the Prometheus Helm chart repository**
```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

#### **Step 2: Create a namespace for monitoring**
```bash
kubectl create namespace monitoring
```

#### **Step 3: Install Prometheus using Helm**
```bash
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring
```

This will install:
- **Prometheus** for monitoring.
- **Alertmanager** for handling alerts.
- **Grafana** for visualization.
- **kube-state-metrics** and **node-exporter** for Kubernetes-specific and system-level metrics.

#### **Step 4: Check the pods**
Ensure all the components are up and running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```
You should see pods for Prometheus, Grafana, and other related services.

---

### **2. Expose Prometheus and Grafana Dashboards**

#### **Step 1: Expose Prometheus**
To access Prometheus through a browser, you need to port-forward the Prometheus server.
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-operated 9090:9090 -n monitoring
```
Now, Prometheus should be available at `http://localhost:9090`.

#### **Step 2: Expose Grafana**
Grafana provides a web UI for visualizing metrics. Port-forward the Grafana service:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
```
Now, Grafana should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### **Step 3: Get Grafana login credentials**
To login to Grafana, the default username is `admin`. To get the default password, run:
```bash
kubectl get secret prometheus-grafana -n monitoring -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode
```

---

### **3. Configure Grafana to Visualize Kubernetes Metrics**
Once logged in to Grafana:

#### **Step 1: Add Prometheus Data Source**
Grafana is already pre-configured to use Prometheus as a data source (thanks to the Helm chart). To check:
- Go to **Configuration > Data Sources**.
- Verify that **Prometheus** is listed and configured with the URL `http://prometheus-operated:9090`.

#### **Step 2: Import Kubernetes Dashboards**
Grafana provides pre-built Kubernetes dashboards. To import:
1. Go to **Create > Import**.
2. Enter the dashboard ID **315** (a popular Kubernetes dashboard).
3. Click **Load** and then **Import**.

---

### **4. Verify Metrics Collection**
Prometheus will start scraping metrics from Kubernetes components like nodes, pods, and containers. To verify:
1. Go to **http://localhost:9090** (Prometheus UI).
2. Try running a basic query:
   ```promQL
   up
   ```
   This query checks if Prometheus is scraping data from your services.

3. You can also query Kubernetes metrics such as node CPU usage:
   ```promQL
   sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{job="kubelet", cluster="", container!="", image!=""}[5m])) by (instance)
   ```

---

### **5. Configure Alerts**
Prometheus can send alerts using **Alertmanager**.

#### **Step 1: Define Alert Rules**
Alert rules can be defined in Prometheus configuration. For example, you can set a rule for high CPU usage:

Create a file named `prometheus-alerts.yaml`:
```yaml
groups:
- name: kubernetes.rules
  rules:
  - alert: HighCPUUsage
    expr: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{job="kubelet", cluster="", container!="", image!=""}[5m])) by (instance) > 0.9
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: High CPU usage detected on {{ $labels.instance }}
```

#### **Step 2: Apply Alert Rules**
You can apply the alert rule file by adding it to the Prometheus configuration through the `values.yaml` file during Helm installation or modifying the existing configuration in Prometheus.

```bash
kubectl apply -f prometheus-alerts.yaml -n monitoring
```

#### **Step 3: Configure Alertmanager for Notifications**
Alertmanager handles the alert notifications. It can send notifications to various services like Slack, PagerDuty, Email, etc.

Edit the `alertmanager-config.yaml`:
```yaml
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  receiver: 'slack-notifications'
receivers:
- name: 'slack-notifications'
  slack_configs:
  - channel: '#alerts'
    send_resolved: true
```

Apply the configuration to Alertmanager:
```bash
kubectl apply -f alertmanager-config.yaml -n monitoring
```

---

### **6. Final Check**
- You can verify the Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to ensure that metrics like CPU, memory, disk usage, and pod metrics are being scraped.
- The alerting configuration will notify you if any predefined thresholds are breached.

---

### **7. Clean Up (Optional)**
To delete everything installed via Helm:
```bash
helm uninstall prometheus -n monitoring
kubectl delete namespace monitoring
```

---

### **Conclusion**
You now have a complete Kubernetes monitoring setup using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Alertmanager**. This setup allows you to:
- Scrape metrics from your Kubernetes cluster.
- Visualize the metrics with Grafana.
- Set up alerting rules for infrastructure issues like high CPU usage.
