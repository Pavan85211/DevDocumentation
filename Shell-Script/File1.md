## Can you explain your experience with AWS and DevOps practices?
A: I have extensive experience working in AWS cloud environments and implementing DevOps practices. My expertise includes setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitLab and Jenkins, managing infrastructure with Terraform, and containerizing applications using Docker and Kubernetes. I have also worked with AWS services like EC2, EKS, S3, VPC, Route 53, ELB, and CloudWatch for application development and monitoring.

## Can you describe a CI/CD pipeline you implemented using GitLab/Jenkins?
A: I have implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins. In GitLab, I configured .gitlab-ci.yml files to define build, test, and deployment stages running in Docker containers. I used GitLab Runners for executing jobs and integrated Docker Hub for managing containerized applications. In Jenkins, I configured pipeline scripts for automating builds, testing, and deployments across multiple environments.
