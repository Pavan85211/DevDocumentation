### 1)Tell me about your roles and responsibilities as a devops engineer with AWS?
Ans)I have extensive experience working in AWS cloud environments and implementing DevOps practices. My expertise includes setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitLab and Jenkins, managing infrastructure with Terraform, and containerizing applications using Docker and Kubernetes. I have also worked with AWS services like EC2, EKS, S3, VPC, Route 53, ELB, and CloudWatch for application development and monitoring.


How do we create CI/CD pipeline?
