## 1.Usage of aliases in shell script?



#### **1️⃣ What is an Alias in Shell?**  
An **alias** is a shortcut for a command or a series of commands. It helps in reducing typing effort and creating user-friendly command shortcuts.

---

### **2️⃣ Creating and Using Aliases**
#### **🔹 Temporary Alias (Valid Only for Current Session)**
You can define an alias using:
```sh
alias ll='ls -lah'
alias gs='git status'
```
- `ll` → Runs `ls -lah`
- `gs` → Runs `git status`

💡 **But these aliases are temporary and lost when the terminal is closed.**

---

### **3️⃣ Using Aliases in a Shell Script**
By default, **aliases are not expanded in shell scripts**. You need to **explicitly enable alias expansion**.

#### **🔹 Enabling Aliases in a Shell Script**
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Enable alias expansion
shopt -s expand_aliases

# Define alias
alias ll='ls -lah'

# Use alias in the script
echo "Listing files using alias:"
ll
```

✅ **Run the script**:
```sh
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

---

### **4️⃣ Permanent Aliases (Persisting Across Sessions)**
To make aliases available **every time you open a terminal**, add them to:  
- `~/.bashrc` (for Bash users)
- `~/.zshrc` (for Zsh users)

```sh
echo "alias ll='ls -lah'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc  # Apply changes immediately
```

---

### **5️⃣ Aliases vs. Functions**
- **Aliases** are simple command shortcuts.
- **Functions** are more powerful (they support arguments and multiple commands).

#### **🔹 Example: Using a Function Instead of an Alias**
```sh
mylist() {
  ls -lah "$1"
}

# Call function with a directory argument
mylist /home/user
```

💡 **Use aliases for simple command replacements and functions for complex logic.**

---

### **6️⃣ When to Use Aliases in Shell Scripts?**
✅ When writing scripts for **interactive use**, where alias expansion is enabled.  
✅ When defining **shortcuts** for repetitive commands.  
✅ When making scripts **more readable and user-friendly**.

## 2.How to retrieve the 100 ip addresses from any text file using shell script?

#### **🔹 Shell Script to Extract 100 IP Addresses**
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Define input file
INPUT_FILE="input.txt"

# Extract first 100 IP addresses and save to output file
grep -oE '\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b' "$INPUT_FILE" | head -n 100 > output.txt

# Print the extracted IPs
cat output.txt
```

---

#### **🔹 Explanation**
1. **grep -oE '\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b' "$INPUT_FILE"**  
   - This extracts **valid IPv4 addresses** from the file.
2. **head -n 100**  
   - Retrieves only the **first 100 IP addresses**.
3. **> output.txt**  
   - Saves the extracted IPs to `output.txt`.

---

#### **🔹 Running the Script**
1. Save the script as `extract_ips.sh`.
2. Give execute permission:
   ```sh
   chmod +x extract_ips.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   ./extract_ips.sh
   ```

---

#### **🔹 Sample Input (input.txt)**
```
User logged in from 192.168.1.10
Connection from 10.0.0.1 failed
Server IP: 172.16.5.20
192.168.1.11 - Access granted
```

#### **🔹 Sample Output (output.txt)**
```
192.168.1.10
10.0.0.1
172.16.5.20
192.168.1.11
```

## 3.Write a bash script to read the last 10 lines of a file and how to get lines having word "out of memory''

Here's a Bash script to read the last 10 lines of a file and extract lines containing the phrase **"out of memory"** (case-insensitive).  

### **Script (`read_logs.sh`)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a filename is provided
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <filename>"
    exit 1
fi

FILE=$1

# Read the last 10 lines and filter lines containing 'out of memory' (case-insensitive)
echo "Last 10 lines of $FILE:"
tail -n 10 "$FILE"

echo -e "\nLines containing 'out of memory' (case-insensitive):"
grep -i "out of memory" "$FILE"
```

### **How to Use**
Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x read_logs.sh
```
Run it with a file as an argument:
```bash
./read_logs.sh /path/to/your/file.log
```

### **Explanation**
1. **`tail -n 10 "$FILE"`** → Displays the last 10 lines of the file.
2. **`grep -i "out of memory" "$FILE"`** → Searches for lines containing "out of memory" (ignoring case).
