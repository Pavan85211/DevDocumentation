## 1.Explain about chmod linux command

## **`chmod` Command in Linux** 🛠️  

The `chmod` (change mode) command is used in Linux to **change file and directory permissions**. It controls **who** can read, write, or execute a file.  

---

## **🔹 Basic Syntax**
```sh
chmod [OPTIONS] MODE FILE
```
- `MODE` → Defines the new permissions (numeric or symbolic).
- `FILE` → The target file or directory.

---

## **🔹 File Permissions in Linux**
Each file has three types of permissions:
| Permission | Symbol | Numeric | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Read       | `r`    | `4`     | View file contents |
| Write      | `w`    | `2`     | Modify file contents |
| Execute    | `x`    | `1`     | Run as a program |

And three user categories:
| Category | Symbol | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Owner    | `u`    | The file's creator |
| Group    | `g`    | Users in the file's group |
| Others   | `o`    | All other users |

---

## **🔹 1. Numeric Mode (Octal)**
You can set permissions using numbers:  
**Example:**
```sh
chmod 755 myfile
```
### **📝 Breakdown (755)**
| User  | Permission | Binary | Numeric |
|-------|------------|--------|---------|
| Owner | `rwx` (read, write, execute) | `111` | `7` |
| Group | `r-x` (read, execute) | `101` | `5` |
| Others | `r-x` (read, execute) | `101` | `5` |

### **Common Octal Permissions**
| Octal | Permissions | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `777` | `rwxrwxrwx` | Everyone can read, write, execute |
| `755` | `rwxr-xr-x` | Owner can modify, others can read & execute |
| `644` | `rw-r--r--` | Owner can write, others can only read |
| `600` | `rw-------` | Only owner can read & write |

---

## **🔹 2. Symbolic Mode**
Symbolic mode allows setting permissions with letters.

### **📝 Example:**
```sh
chmod u+x myscript.sh
```
✅ Adds execute (`+x`) permission **to the owner (u)**.

### **Other Examples**
| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `chmod g-w myfile` | Remove write (`-w`) permission **from group** |
| `chmod o+r myfile` | Add read (`+r`) permission **for others** |
| `chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile` | Set exact permissions |

---

## **🔹 3. Change Permissions for Directories**
For directories, you often need `-R` (**recursive**) to apply changes to all files inside.

```sh
chmod -R 755 mydirectory/
```
✅ Sets `755` permissions **for all files & subdirectories**.

---

## **🔹 4. Special Permissions (`SUID`, `SGID`, `Sticky Bit`)**
| Mode | Octal | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **SUID (`s`)** | `4000` | Run file as the owner |
| **SGID (`s`)** | `2000` | Run file as the group |
| **Sticky Bit (`t`)** | `1000` | Prevent deletion by non-owners |

### **Example:**
```sh
chmod 4755 myscript.sh  # Adds SUID
chmod 2755 myfolder/    # Adds SGID
chmod 1755 myfolder/    # Adds Sticky Bit
```

---

## **🔹 5. Check File Permissions**
Use `ls -l` to see file permissions:
```sh
ls -l myfile
```
### **Example Output:**
```
-rwxr-xr--  1 user group  1234 Feb 14 10:00 myfile
```
- **`-rwxr-xr--`** → Owner (`rwx`), Group (`r-x`), Others (`r--`)

---

## **🔹 Summary**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `chmod 777 file` | Everyone has full permissions |
| `chmod 755 file` | Owner has full, others can read/execute |
| `chmod 644 file` | Owner can write, others can only read |
| `chmod +x script.sh` | Make script executable |
| `chmod -R 755 dir/` | Apply permissions recursively |

## 2.explain about chown linux command

## **`chown` Command in Linux** 🛠️  

The `chown` (change owner) command is used in Linux to **change file or directory ownership**. It allows administrators or the file owner to assign a new **user** and/or **group** ownership.

---

## **🔹 Basic Syntax**
```sh
chown [OPTIONS] USER[:GROUP] FILE
```
- `USER` → The new owner of the file.
- `GROUP` → (Optional) The new group of the file.
- `FILE` → The target file or directory.

---

## **🔹 1. Change File Owner**
```sh
chown newuser myfile
```
✅ This changes the **owner** of `myfile` to `newuser`, but keeps the group unchanged.

---

## **🔹 2. Change File Owner and Group**
```sh
chown newuser:newgroup myfile
```
✅ This sets:
- **Owner →** `newuser`
- **Group →** `newgroup`

### **Alternative Syntax:**
```sh
chown newuser.newgroup myfile   # Also valid
chown newuser:newgroup myfile   # Preferred syntax
```

---

## **🔹 3. Change Only the Group**
If you only want to change the **group** but keep the owner:
```sh
chown :newgroup myfile
```
✅ The owner remains the same, but the file's **group** changes to `newgroup`.

---

## **🔹 4. Change Ownership Recursively (`-R`)**
If you need to change ownership for all files and directories inside a folder:
```sh
chown -R newuser:newgroup mydirectory/
```
✅ Changes ownership **recursively** for everything inside `mydirectory/`.

---

## **🔹 5. Transfer Ownership from Another User**
If you want to change ownership **only if the file is owned by a specific user**, use `--from`:
```sh
chown --from=currentuser newuser myfile
```
✅ This changes ownership **only if `currentuser` owns `myfile`**.

---

## **🔹 6. Change Ownership Using UID or GID**
Instead of specifying a username or group name, you can use their **User ID (UID)** or **Group ID (GID)**.

```sh
chown 1001:1002 myfile
```
✅ This assigns:
- **Owner** → User with UID `1001`
- **Group** → Group with GID `1002`

To find UID and GID:
```sh
id username
```

---

## **🔹 7. Verify Ownership (`ls -l`)**
After running `chown`, check file ownership:
```sh
ls -l myfile
```
### **Example Output**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 newuser newgroup 1234 Feb 14 10:00 myfile
```
- **Owner →** `newuser`
- **Group →** `newgroup`

---

## **🔹 8. Prevent Accidental Ownership Changes (`--preserve-root`)**
To **avoid changing ownership of system-critical files** like `/`, use:
```sh
chown --preserve-root -R newuser /
```
✅ This prevents accidental system-wide changes.

---

## **🔹 9. Change Ownership for Symbolic Links (`-h` and `-L`)**
By default, `chown` **ignores** symbolic links. To change ownership of a **symlink itself**, use:
```sh
chown -h newuser:newgroup symlink
```
✅ Changes the owner **of the symlink**, not the target file.

To change the target file's owner instead:
```sh
chown -L newuser:newgroup symlink
```

---

## **🔹 Summary Table**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `chown newuser myfile` | Change owner to `newuser` |
| `chown newuser:newgroup myfile` | Change both owner and group |
| `chown :newgroup myfile` | Change only the group |
| `chown -R newuser:newgroup mydirectory/` | Change ownership recursively |
| `chown --from=currentuser newuser myfile` | Change owner only if the current owner is `currentuser` |
| `chown -h newuser symlink` | Change owner of a symbolic link |
| `ls -l myfile` | Check file ownership |

## 3.explain about SED linux command

## **`sed` Command in Linux** 🛠️  

The `sed` (Stream Editor) command is used for **text processing, find-and-replace, deletion, and text manipulation** in Linux. It processes files line by line and **doesn't modify the original file** unless explicitly told to do so.

---

## **🔹 Basic Syntax**
```sh
sed [OPTIONS] 'COMMAND' FILE
```
- `COMMAND` → The operation to perform (e.g., substitute, delete, print).
- `FILE` → The input file to process.

---

## **🔹 1. Find and Replace (Substitution)**
The `s` command is used for substitution (`s/old/new/`).

### **Replace First Occurrence in Each Line**
```sh
sed 's/hello/world/' myfile.txt
```
✅ Replaces the **first occurrence** of `hello` with `world` in each line.

### **Replace All Occurrences in Each Line (`g` for Global)**
```sh
sed 's/hello/world/g' myfile.txt
```
✅ Replaces **all occurrences** of `hello` with `world`.

### **Replace Only in Specific Lines**
```sh
sed '2s/hello/world/' myfile.txt
```
✅ Replaces `hello` with `world` **only in line 2**.

---

## **🔹 2. Delete Lines (`d` Command)**
### **Delete a Specific Line**
```sh
sed '3d' myfile.txt
```
✅ Deletes **line 3**.

### **Delete a Range of Lines**
```sh
sed '2,5d' myfile.txt
```
✅ Deletes lines **2 to 5**.

### **Delete Lines Containing a Specific Word**
```sh
sed '/error/d' myfile.txt
```
✅ Deletes **all lines** that contain the word `error`.

---

## **🔹 3. Print Specific Lines (`p` Command)**
### **Print a Specific Line**
```sh
sed -n '3p' myfile.txt
```
✅ Prints **only line 3**.

### **Print Lines Matching a Pattern**
```sh
sed -n '/hello/p' myfile.txt
```
✅ Prints **only lines** containing `hello`.

---

## **🔹 4. Insert or Append Text**
### **Insert a Line Before a Specific Line (`i`)**
```sh
sed '3i This is a new line' myfile.txt
```
✅ Inserts `This is a new line` **before line 3**.

### **Append a Line After a Specific Line (`a`)**
```sh
sed '3a This is an added line' myfile.txt
```
✅ Adds `This is an added line` **after line 3**.

---

## **🔹 5. Modify Original File (`-i` Option)**
By default, `sed` does not modify the original file. Use `-i` to save changes:
```sh
sed -i 's/old/new/g' myfile.txt
```
✅ **Modifies `myfile.txt` directly.** (Be careful!)

---

## **🔹 6. Replace Text in Multiple Files**
```sh
sed -i 's/error/fixed/g' *.txt
```
✅ Replaces `error` with `fixed` in **all `.txt` files**.

---

## **🔹 7. Use with Piping**
```sh
echo "hello world" | sed 's/world/universe/'
```
✅ Outputs: `hello universe`

---

## **🔹 Summary Table**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sed 's/old/new/' file.txt` | Replace first occurrence of `old` with `new` in each line |
| `sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt` | Replace **all** occurrences in each line |
| `sed '2s/old/new/' file.txt` | Replace only in line **2** |
| `sed '3d' file.txt` | Delete line **3** |
