## 1.what is use of container in Kubernetes ?


#### **1️⃣ Definition of a Container**  
A **container** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application—**code, dependencies, libraries, and runtime environment**. In **Kubernetes**, containers are the **smallest deployable units** that run inside **Pods**.

---

### **2️⃣ Why Use Containers in Kubernetes?**  

#### **🔹 Portability**  
- Containers **package the application and its dependencies** together.
- They run the **same way** across different environments (development, testing, production).
- Example: A Python app with all required libraries can run on any Kubernetes cluster **without compatibility issues**.

#### **🔹 Scalability & Resource Efficiency**  
- Kubernetes can **easily scale containers up or down** based on traffic or CPU/memory usage.
- Containers **use fewer resources** than Virtual Machines (VMs) because they share the host OS kernel.

#### **🔹 Isolation**  
- Each container runs in **its own isolated environment**, preventing conflicts between applications.
- Example: You can run **Node.js, Python, and Java applications** on the same Kubernetes cluster **without dependency conflicts**.

#### **🔹 Automation & Self-Healing**  
- Kubernetes automatically **restarts failed containers**, ensuring high availability.
- Example: If a container crashes, Kubernetes replaces it **without manual intervention**.

#### **🔹 Continuous Deployment & Rolling Updates**  
- Containers **enable seamless updates** without downtime.
- Kubernetes supports **rolling updates**, ensuring smooth application upgrades.

### **3️⃣ How Containers Work in Kubernetes?**  

1. **Containers run inside Pods** (the smallest unit in Kubernetes).
2. **Pods are managed by Deployments** (to ensure desired container state).
3. **Kubernetes uses a Container Runtime** (like Docker or containerd) to run the containers.
4. **Containers communicate with each other** using Kubernetes Services.

**Example YAML for a Container Running in Kubernetes:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

### **4️⃣ Interview-Friendly Summary**  
> "Containers in Kubernetes provide an isolated, portable, and scalable way to run applications. They allow for efficient resource usage, enable automated scaling and self-healing, and simplify deployment processes. Kubernetes manages containers using Pods and orchestrates them for high availability and seamless updates."

## 2. How do you update resources when you are using deployments in k8s?
There are multiple ways to update CPU and memory resources in a Deployment:

#### Update the YAML Manifest and Apply Changes
Kubernetes uses the requests and limits fields in the resources section of the deployment YAML.
Requests: The minimum amount of CPU/memory a container needs.
Limits: The maximum amount of CPU/memory a container can use.


```yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-app:v2
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "250m"      # Minimum CPU required
              memory: "256Mi"  # Minimum Memory required
            limits:
              cpu: "500m"      # Maximum CPU allowed
              memory: "512Mi"  # Maximum Memory allowed



#### Monitor Resource Usage (CPU/Memory):
   kubectl top pod

```

## 12.how to debug the process while deploy the deployments in kubernetes?

###  Debugging Kubernetes deployments requires checking different components such as Pods, Deployments, Logs, Events, and Network configurations. Here’s a systematic approach:



#### **1. Check Deployment Status**
Run the following command to check if the deployment is progressing or failing:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```
If your deployment is not running correctly, check its detailed status:
```bash
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
```
This will show events like failed image pulls, insufficient resources, etc.

---

#### **2. Check Pod Status**
Check if the Pods are running or stuck in a different state:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
If a pod is not running, inspect it with:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
Look for **Warnings** or **Events** that indicate issues like:
- `ImagePullBackOff` – Wrong image name or tag.
- `CrashLoopBackOff` – The container keeps crashing.
- `ErrImagePull` – Issue with pulling the container image.

---

#### **3. Check Logs**
If the pod is running but misbehaving, check logs:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
For multi-container pods:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>
```
If logs are too long, use:
```bash
kubectl logs --tail=50 <pod-name>
```

---

#### **4. Check Events**
Kubernetes records events related to failures:
```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```
Look for any `Failed`, `Warning`, or `Error` events.

---

#### **5. Debug Inside the Pod**
If logs don’t reveal the issue, you can exec into the pod:
```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh  # If Alpine/Linux
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash  # If Ubuntu/Debian-based
```
From inside the pod, check:
- **Network connectivity:**  
  ```bash
  ping <service-name>
  curl http://<service-name>:<port>
  ```
- **Environment variables:**  
  ```bash
  env
  ```
- **Running processes:**  
  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```

---

#### **6. Check Kubernetes Service & DNS**
If your pods are running but not communicating properly:
```bash
kubectl get svc
```
If DNS is not resolving:
```bash
kubectl run -it --rm --image=busybox dns-test -- nslookup <service-name>
```

---

#### **7. Check Node & Cluster Health**
If there are node issues, run:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```
For cluster-wide issues:
```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get componentstatuses
```

---

#### **8. Check Failed Pods**
If pods are stuck in a failed state:
```bash
kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Failed
kubectl logs <failed-pod-name>
```
To remove failed pods:
```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

---

#### **9. Debug Init Containers**
If your pod has **init containers**, check their logs:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <init-container-name>
```

---

#### **10. Troubleshoot PVC Issues**
If using Persistent Volumes, check if they are bound:
```bash
kubectl get pvc
kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>
```

---

#### **11. Restart & Reapply Deployment**
If necessary, restart the deployment:
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>
```
Or delete and recreate:
```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

---

#### **12. Check Docker Container Logs on Node**
If Kubernetes logs don’t help, check the node’s container runtime:
```bash
docker ps -a
docker logs <container-id>
```
(For containerd: `crictl logs <container-id>`)
