```
Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
```

âœ… **Tip:** Save the plan for later execution:
```sh
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

### **3. Terraform Apply (Deploy Infrastructure)**
#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform apply`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform apply
```
- Creates or updates resources as per the Terraform configuration.
- Prompts for confirmation before applying changes.

**Apply Without Prompting:**

```sh
terraform apply tfplan
```

#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform destroy`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform destroy
```

```
- Displays the current state of the infrastructure.

---

### **6. Terraform State Management**
#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform state list`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform state list
```
- Lists all resources in the Terraform state.

#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform state show <resource_name>`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform state show aws_instance.my_instance
```
- Shows detailed information about a specific resource in the state.

#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform state mv <old> <new>`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform state mv aws_instance.old_instance aws_instance.new_instance
```
- Moves a resource in the state file.

#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform state rm <resource_name>`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform state rm aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket
```
- Removes a resource from the state without destroying it.

---

### **7. Terraform Format & Validation**
#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform fmt`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform fmt
```
- Formats Terraform configuration files for readability.

#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform validate`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform validate
```
- Checks for syntax errors and configuration issues.

---

### **8. Terraform Output**
#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform output`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform output
```
- Displays the output values from Terraform.

**Example:**
```sh
terraform output instance_ip
```

---

### **9. Terraform Import (Import Existing Resources)**
#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform import`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform import aws_instance.my_instance i-1234567890abcdef
```
- Imports an existing resource into Terraform state.

---

### **10. Terraform Graph (Visualize Dependencies)**
#### ðŸ”¹ `terraform graph`
**Usage:**  
```sh
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png
```
- Generates a graph of resource dependencies.

---
