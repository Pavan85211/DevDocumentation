### **Load Balancing in AWS: A Detailed Overview**

**Load Balancing** in AWS refers to the distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple resources (such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses) to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability of your applications. By distributing traffic evenly, load balancing helps avoid overloading any single resource and ensures a smooth and reliable user experience.

In AWS, the main service for load balancing is **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**. AWS provides various types of load balancers based on the application and networking needs.

---

## **1. Types of Load Balancers in AWS**

## **2. Key Features of AWS Load Balancers**

### ✅ **1️⃣ Auto Scaling Integration**
AWS Load Balancers integrate seamlessly with **Auto Scaling Groups**. Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in traffic, and the load balancer distributes traffic across these instances to maintain optimal performance.

### ✅ **2️⃣ Health Checks**
Load balancers continuously monitor the health of registered targets (e.g., EC2 instances). If an instance becomes unhealthy, the load balancer stops routing traffic to it and directs traffic to healthy instances. This helps ensure high availability and reliability.

### ✅ **3️⃣ SSL/TLS Termination**
AWS Load Balancers provide **SSL/TLS termination**, allowing you to offload SSL decryption at the load balancer level. This helps reduce the load on backend servers, which no longer need to handle encryption/decryption tasks, improving performance.

### ✅ **4️⃣ WebSocket and HTTP/2 Support**
- **WebSocket**: ALB supports WebSocket connections, which allow for persistent, real-time communication between clients and servers.
- **HTTP/2**: ALB supports HTTP/2, which provides improved performance over HTTP/1.1 by enabling multiplexing of multiple requests over a single connection.

### ✅ **5️⃣ Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)**
AWS Load Balancers can be configured for **sticky sessions**, which direct a user’s requests to the same backend instance during the duration of the session. This is useful for applications that require session persistence, such as shopping carts or user profiles.

### ✅ **6️⃣ IP Address-Based Targeting**
You can configure load balancers to route traffic to **IP addresses** instead of EC2 instances. This allows you to target resources outside of AWS (such as on-premises servers) and enables hybrid cloud architectures.

---

## **3. How Load Balancing Works in AWS**

### **Step 1: Client Sends a Request**
A client sends an HTTP or TCP request to an application hosted in AWS.

### **Step 2: Load Balancer Routes Traffic**
The request is directed to the load balancer. Based on the load balancer type and configuration (e.g., host-based, path-based, round-robin), the load balancer routes the request to one of the available **target instances**.

### **Step 3: Health Checks**
The load balancer performs periodic health checks to ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy targets. If a target fails a health check, it is automatically removed from the pool of available targets.

### **Step 4: Response to Client**
Once the request reaches a healthy target, the instance processes the request and sends a response back through the load balancer to the client.

### **Step 5: Auto Scaling (If Applicable)**
If the load balancer detects an increase in traffic, it can trigger **Auto Scaling** to add more instances to the backend pool to handle the traffic.

---

## **4. Benefits of Load Balancing in AWS**

### ✅ **1️⃣ High Availability**
AWS load balancers help ensure that your application is highly available by distributing traffic across multiple instances and automatically rerouting traffic if an instance becomes unhealthy.

### ✅ **2️⃣ Scalability**
With **Auto Scaling** and dynamic adjustment of traffic distribution, AWS load balancers enable you to scale your application based on traffic demands.

### ✅ **3️⃣ Improved Performance**
By offloading tasks like SSL termination and distributing traffic efficiently, AWS load balancers reduce the load on individual EC2 instances, improving the overall performance of your application.

### ✅ **4️⃣ Security**
AWS load balancers help secure your applications by enabling SSL/TLS encryption, using security policies, and integrating with **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) to block malicious requests.

### ✅ **5️⃣ Cost-Effectiveness**
AWS load balancers offer a pay-as-you-go pricing model, meaning you only pay for the resources used. Additionally, they can help optimize resource usage by distributing traffic evenly, preventing overprovisioning.

### **Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS: A Detailed Explanation**

The **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is a fully managed Layer 7 (Application Layer) load balancing service provided by AWS. It is part of the **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** suite and is specifically designed for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. ALB offers advanced routing capabilities, making it ideal for modern applications, such as microservices, containerized applications, and web applications that require routing decisions based on content.

---

## **Key Features of Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

### 1. **Content-Based Routing**
ALB provides content-based routing, allowing you to route incoming traffic based on different attributes such as:
- **URL path**: Direct traffic to different backend services based on the URL path (e.g., `/api` to one service and `/images` to another).
- **Host-based routing**: Route traffic based on the domain name in the request (e.g., `app.example.com` to one backend and `api.example.com` to another).
- **Query string or headers**: Route traffic based on query parameters or specific headers in the HTTP request.

**Example**: You could have:
- Traffic to `/v1/*` sent to one target group (API version 1).
- Traffic to `/v2/*` routed to another target group (API version 2).

This feature is useful for modern, dynamic applications like **microservices**.

### 2. **Supports HTTP/2 and WebSocket**
- **HTTP/2**: ALB supports HTTP/2, which provides several performance enhancements over HTTP/1.1, such as multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection, header compression, and prioritization of requests.
- **WebSocket**: ALB supports WebSocket connections, enabling real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and servers.

**Use case**: Real-time applications like messaging systems, live data feeds, and online games can leverage WebSockets for persistent connections.

### 3. **SSL/TLS Termination**
ALB can terminate **SSL/TLS** connections, which means it decrypts HTTPS traffic at the load balancer level before forwarding it to the backend instances over HTTP. This offloading of SSL/TLS processing from the backend instances improves performance and reduces the load on them.

- **Benefits**: Simplifies SSL certificate management and offloads the heavy lifting of encryption/decryption from backend servers.

### 4. **Target Groups and Health Checks**
ALB uses **target groups** to manage backend instances (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, etc.). Each target group consists of one or more targets that ALB distributes traffic to based on routing rules.

- **Health Checks**: ALB performs regular health checks on targets in the target group. If a target fails the health check, ALB automatically stops routing traffic to it and redirects traffic to healthy targets.
- **Types of Targets**: Targets can be EC2 instances, ECS services, Lambda functions, or IP addresses (for hybrid architectures).

### 5. **Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)**
ALB supports **sticky sessions** (session affinity), where requests from a particular client are consistently routed to the same target instance for the duration of a session. This is useful for applications that require session persistence, like shopping carts or user authentication.

**Example**: When a user logs into an application, ALB ensures that their requests are always routed to the same backend instance to maintain the user's session.

### 6. **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**
ALB supports **cross-zone load balancing**, meaning that traffic is distributed evenly across all healthy targets in all availability zones (AZs), regardless of the client’s geographic location or which AZ the targets are in. This enhances the availability and reliability of your application.

### 7. **Access Logs**
ALB provides **access logs** that capture detailed information about each request processed by the load balancer, including request details like the source IP, request path, target response time, and more. These logs are helpful for monitoring, debugging, and auditing traffic.

### 8. **Security Features**
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Integration**: ALB can be integrated with **AWS WAF** to protect your applications from common web exploits such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Security Groups**: ALB supports security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your load balancer.

---

## **How Does Application Load Balancer Work?**

### **Step 1: Client Sends Request**
When a client (e.g., a browser or mobile app) sends an HTTP or HTTPS request, the request is routed to the **Application Load Balancer**.

### **Step 2: ALB Routes Traffic Based on Rules**
ALB examines the request based on the **routing rules** you’ve configured. It determines how to route the traffic to the appropriate target group (which can contain EC2 instances, ECS containers, Lambda functions, etc.).

- If the request matches a rule (e.g., path `/images`), ALB forwards the request to the corresponding target group.

### **Step 3: Health Checks**
Before forwarding the request, ALB checks whether the target is healthy by performing periodic **health checks** on the target group.

- If the target is unhealthy, ALB automatically routes the traffic to the next available healthy target.

### **Step 4: Target Responds**
The selected target (e.g., an EC2 instance) processes the request and sends back a response to ALB.

### **Step 5: ALB Forwards Response to Client**
ALB forwards the response from the backend target to the client.

### **Step 6: Session Persistence (Optional)**
If sticky sessions are enabled, ALB ensures the client’s future requests are directed to the same backend target for the duration of the session.

---

## **Use Cases for Application Load Balancer**

### 1. **Microservices Architectures**
In a microservices architecture, each service might be hosted on different EC2 instances or containers. ALB helps route traffic to the right service based on URL paths or hostnames.

- **Example**: `/user-service` routes to a user service, `/order-service` routes to an order service.

### 2. **Web Applications**
ALB is commonly used to distribute web traffic across multiple EC2 instances running a web application. It enables scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance for web-based applications.

- **Example**: A high-traffic e-commerce website can use ALB to distribute requests to EC2 instances handling product pages, user accounts, checkout, etc.

### 3. **Real-Time Applications**
ALB supports WebSocket connections, which are used in real-time applications such as chat applications, live streaming platforms, and online games.

- **Example**: A live chat application can use WebSockets for persistent, two-way communication between users and the backend.

### 4. **Containerized Applications**
When using **Amazon ECS** or **Amazon EKS**, ALB can be used to route traffic to containers based on the content of the request, allowing for efficient traffic distribution to different microservices running in containers.

- **Example**: Microservices in ECS can each be routed based on different URL paths like `/api/v1` for one service and `/api/v2` for another.

### 5. **API Gateway**
ALB can serve as a front-end for APIs, routing traffic to different API versions or endpoints based on URL paths or hostnames.

---

## **Benefits of Application Load Balancer**

### 1. **Advanced Traffic Routing**
With ALB’s path-based, host-based, and query string-based routing, you can flexibly direct traffic to different target groups, which is especially useful for microservices and containerized applications.

### 2. **Scalability and High Availability**
ALB automatically adjusts to changes in traffic, distributes requests across multiple backend instances, and ensures high availability by routing traffic only to healthy targets.

### 3. **Reduced Latency**
ALB is optimized to handle high-volume HTTP/HTTPS requests and offers low-latency routing for web applications, ensuring faster response times for users.

### 4. **Security and Compliance**
With SSL/TLS termination and integration with AWS WAF, ALB helps secure your application and ensures compliance with industry standards.

### 5. **Cost Efficiency**

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Application Load Balancer** is an essential component for modern, scalable applications in AWS. It offers advanced routing capabilities, support for microservices and containers, SSL termination, WebSocket support, and more, making it an ideal choice for web applications, microservices, and real-time applications that require intelligent, content-based traffic routing. By leveraging ALB, you can build high-availability, high-performance applications that scale with user demand.

### **Example: Application Load Balancer in Action for a Web Application**

Let’s take an example of an **e-commerce web application** that uses an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to route traffic to various microservices. The application consists of different services such as **User Service**, **Product Service**, and **Order Service**, each running on separate backend EC2 instances.

### **Scenario:**
- You have an e-commerce site hosted on AWS, and you need to handle multiple requests such as browsing products, managing user accounts, and processing orders.
- You want the ALB to route the traffic to the appropriate backend service based on the **URL path** of the request.
  - **/user** → Routes to the **User Service**
  - **/products** → Routes to the **Product Service**
  - **/orders** → Routes to the **Order Service**

### **Architecture Overview:**
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: It will distribute incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests based on content (URL path).
- **Target Groups**: ALB will have 3 target groups:
  - **User Service Target Group**: Consists of EC2 instances running the User Service.
  - **Product Service Target Group**: Consists of EC2 instances running the Product Service.
  - **Order Service Target Group**: Consists of EC2 instances running the Order Service.
  
### **Step-by-Step Workflow:**

1. **User Sends Request to the ALB**
   - A user visits the site and sends an HTTP request to the ALB, for example:  
     `https://ecommerce-site.com/products/12345`

2. **ALB Examines the URL Path and Routes Traffic**
   - The ALB looks at the path `/products/12345` and applies the routing rule:
     - Route requests with the `/products` path to the **Product Service Target Group**.

3. **ALB Forwards the Request to the Correct Target Group**
   - The ALB forwards the request to one of the healthy EC2 instances in the **Product Service Target Group**.

4. **Backend EC2 Instance Processes the Request**
   - The **Product Service** backend instance processes the request, retrieves the product details for ID `12345`, and prepares a response.

5. **ALB Sends the Response to the User**
   - The response (e.g., product details) is sent back through the ALB, which forwards it to the user’s browser.

6. **Session Persistence (Optional)**
   - If the user adds the product to their shopping cart, ALB can ensure that all subsequent requests (e.g., checkout) are routed to the same backend instance using **sticky sessions**.

### **Additional Example Routes:**
- **User Account Management**:
  - Request: `https://ecommerce-site.com/user/account`
  - ALB routes the request to the **User Service Target Group**.
  
- **Placing an Order**:
  - Request: `https://ecommerce-site.com/orders/place`
  - ALB routes the request to the **Order Service Target Group**.

---

### **Benefits of This Setup:**
1. **Scalability**: Each backend service (User, Product, Order) can scale independently based on demand. ALB will distribute traffic to all healthy instances in each service’s target group.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: If any backend instance becomes unhealthy (e.g., the User Service instance fails), ALB will stop routing traffic to it and direct traffic to other healthy instances in the target group.
3. **Security**: ALB can handle SSL termination, ensuring encrypted communication with users, and can forward traffic to backend services over HTTP.
4. **Performance**: ALB optimizes routing by using content-based rules, ensuring requests are efficiently directed to the right service.
5. **Microservices**: This architecture supports **microservices** by routing requests to the appropriate service, enabling easy development and maintenance of different application components.

---

This is a simple example of how **Application Load Balancer** can help manage traffic in a modern, distributed architecture for an e-commerce website, ensuring scalability, availability, and high performance.

### **Network Load Balancer (NLB) Overview**

A **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is a highly scalable, high-performance load balancer that operates at the **transport layer** (Layer 4) of the OSI model. NLB is designed to handle **TCP** and **UDP** traffic, making it ideal for applications that require high performance, low latency, and support for non-HTTP protocols.

NLB is commonly used for applications that require:
- Low-latency and high-throughput performance.
- Handling large volumes of traffic.
- Support for TCP and UDP traffic.
- High availability and fault tolerance.

---

### **Key Features of NLB**

1. **Layer 4 Load Balancing (TCP/UDP)**:
   - NLB operates at the **transport layer (Layer 4)** of the OSI model, meaning it handles traffic based on IP address and port. It supports both **TCP** and **UDP** protocols, which makes it suitable for applications that require network-level routing like gaming, VoIP, and real-time communications.

2. **Extreme Performance and Low Latency**:
   - NLB is designed to handle millions of requests per second with very low latency, making it a good fit for high-performance applications, such as real-time gaming or high-throughput systems.

3. **Static IP and Elastic IP Support**:
   - NLB provides a **static IP** for your load balancer, which is useful when you need to have a fixed IP address for clients to connect to.
   - It also supports **Elastic IPs**, which can be associated with the NLB, allowing you to easily reassign IPs if needed.

4. **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**:
   - NLB supports **cross-zone load balancing**, which distributes traffic evenly across instances in multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for fault tolerance and high availability.

5. **Health Checks**:
   - NLB performs **health checks** to monitor the health of backend instances. If a target (e.g., EC2 instance) becomes unhealthy, NLB automatically stops routing traffic to that instance and routes it to healthy targets.

6. **TLS Termination (Optional)**:
   - NLB can terminate **TLS/SSL connections** at the load balancer, which offloads the decryption process from backend instances, improving performance. This is useful for applications that need encrypted communication (like HTTPS) but want to handle encryption centrally.

7. **High Availability**:
   - NLB is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It operates across multiple AZs to provide **built-in redundancy**, ensuring that traffic is routed to healthy instances, even if an AZ experiences a failure.

8. **Security Integration**:
   - NLB integrates with **AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)**, allowing you to protect your application from common threats, such as DDoS attacks or SQL injection.

---

### **Use Cases for NLB**

1. **Real-Time Applications**:
   - **Gaming**: Multiplayer online games require low-latency communication between clients and servers. NLB can distribute traffic to game servers efficiently.
   - **Voice over IP (VoIP)**: NLB handles UDP traffic well, which is typically used for VoIP communication.

2. **TCP/UDP-based Services**:
   - **Database Clusters**: When you need to load balance database traffic (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) across multiple database nodes.
   - **FTP or File Transfer Services**: For managing file transfers over TCP or UDP.

3. **Microservices**:
   - When services in a microservices architecture communicate using TCP or UDP protocols, NLB can be used to route traffic between services.

4. **IoT Applications**:
   - Internet of Things (IoT) systems often use TCP/UDP communication for device-to-cloud communication, and NLB can provide scalable and low-latency load balancing for IoT traffic.

---

### **How NLB Works:**

1. **Traffic Flow**:
   - A client sends a TCP or UDP request to the NLB’s IP address and port.
   - The NLB inspects the request and forwards it to one of the healthy backend EC2 instances in the target group.

2. **Target Groups**:
   - Targets in an NLB’s target group can be EC2 instances, IP addresses, or AWS Lambda functions.
   - NLB performs health checks on the targets, ensuring that only healthy targets receive traffic.

3. **Health Checks**:
   - NLB can perform health checks at the network layer (TCP connections) to determine if a target is healthy.
   - If a target is unhealthy, NLB automatically reroutes traffic to other healthy instances.

4. **Static IPs and Elastic IPs**:
   - NLB provides **static IPs** for the load balancer, so clients always know the IP address to send their requests to.
   - It also supports **Elastic IPs**, which provide a fixed IP address for applications that need it.

---

### **Example: Use of NLB for a Gaming Application**

Imagine you are hosting a real-time multiplayer **gaming application** that requires very low-latency communication between players and game servers. You want to use NLB to ensure that:

- The incoming game traffic is distributed efficiently to your game backend servers, which are running on EC2 instances.
- The game backend is deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for fault tolerance.
- Players can always connect to the game servers even if one AZ fails.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Create an NLB**: You configure a **TCP listener** for port `5000`, where game traffic will arrive.
2. **Set Up Target Groups**: You create a target group that contains EC2 instances running the game backend in multiple AZs.
3. **Health Checks**: NLB performs health checks on the EC2 instances. If an instance becomes unhealthy, NLB routes traffic to other healthy game server instances.
4. **Connect Clients**: The players connect to the game using the static IP provided by NLB (e.g., `game.example.com:5000`).
5. **Traffic Distribution**: NLB forwards incoming game requests to the backend EC2 instances based on load and health.

---

### **Benefits of NLB:**

- **Scalability**: Can handle millions of requests per second with low latency, making it ideal for high-traffic, real-time applications.
- **Performance**: Operating at Layer 4, NLB offers faster performance compared to Layer 7 load balancers like the Application Load Balancer (ALB).
- **High Availability**: Ensures that traffic is always routed to healthy targets, and in case of failures, traffic is automatically rerouted.
- **Support for TCP/UDP**: NLB is built to handle TCP and UDP traffic, making it suitable for many types of applications that do not rely on HTTP/HTTPS.

---

### **Conclusion**

A **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is best suited for high-performance, low-latency applications that require handling TCP/UDP traffic. It is widely used for real-time applications such as online gaming, VoIP, and other network-level traffic management. NLB provides **scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility** while ensuring minimal latency and handling large volumes of traffic.

### **Example: Network Load Balancer (NLB) in Action**

Let’s walk through an example of how a **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is used to handle high-throughput, low-latency network traffic for a real-time application, such as a **gaming application**.

### **Scenario:**
You have a **real-time multiplayer game** that needs to handle large volumes of traffic from players around the world. The game’s backend is hosted on multiple EC2 instances across different Availability Zones (AZs) in a VPC.

In this scenario, you want to use a **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** to handle incoming TCP or UDP traffic from players and route it to the appropriate backend EC2 instances in a highly available and low-latency manner.

### **Architecture Overview:**
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: NLB is optimized for high-performance traffic, routing TCP and UDP traffic based on IP address and port.
- **Target Groups**: NLB routes incoming traffic to target groups. Each target group contains a set of EC2 instances running the game backend in multiple AZs to ensure availability and fault tolerance.

### **Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. **User Sends a Request to the Game Server**
   - A player sends a connection request to the game server using the game’s client application, e.g., `game.example.com:5000` (where `5000` is the port for game communication).

2. **NLB Receives the Connection**
   - The connection request is received by the **Network Load Balancer**. The NLB is designed to handle millions of requests per second, and it operates at the **connection level** (Layer 4 – TCP/UDP).

3. **NLB Routes Traffic to the Right Target Group Based on IP and Port**
   - The NLB evaluates the incoming traffic and uses **TCP/UDP listeners** to forward the connection to the appropriate target group.
     - In this example, the NLB could have a TCP listener on port `5000` for game connections.
     - The NLB will check the health of the EC2 instances in the target group and forward the request to one of the healthy instances.

4. **NLB Forwards Traffic to the Game Backend EC2 Instances**
   - Once the NLB identifies a healthy EC2 instance in the target group, it forwards the connection request (TCP packet) to one of the backend EC2 instances running the game backend.
     - The game backend could be an EC2 instance running a Node.js server, for example, that handles real-time multiplayer communications.
     - The backend instance processes the request, handles player actions, and maintains game state.

5. **Game Server Responds to the Player**
   - The game backend instance processes the request (e.g., player moves, updates game state) and sends a response back to the NLB.
   - The NLB forwards the response to the player’s game client application using the same established connection.

6. **Health Checks and Load Balancing**
   - NLB regularly performs **health checks** (e.g., TCP connection checks) on the backend EC2 instances.
     - If an EC2 instance becomes unhealthy or unresponsive (e.g., game server crashes or becomes slow), NLB automatically removes the unhealthy instance from the target group and starts routing traffic to another healthy instance.
   - This ensures that players are always connected to a healthy game server, providing high availability and minimal downtime.

### **Configuration Example:**

- **Listeners**: 
  - **TCP listener** on port `5000` (for real-time game traffic).
  - You can configure additional listeners if the game uses other ports, like `5001` for game updates or `5002` for chat messages.

- **Target Groups**:
  - **Game Backend Target Group**: Contains EC2 instances running the game server application. NLB will forward game traffic to these instances.

- **Health Checks**:
  - Health checks are done using a simple TCP connection on port `5000`. If the EC2 instance does not respond, NLB marks it as unhealthy and routes traffic to another instance.

- **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**:
  - Since the backend EC2 instances are spread across multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)** for fault tolerance, NLB automatically distributes traffic across AZs, ensuring a highly available architecture.

---

### **Why Use NLB in This Scenario?**

1. **High Performance and Low Latency**:
   - NLB operates at the connection level (Layer 4) and can handle millions of requests per second while maintaining very low latency. This is critical for real-time applications like multiplayer games, where players expect immediate feedback.

2. **TCP/UDP Support**:
   - NLB is designed to handle **TCP** and **UDP** traffic, making it ideal for gaming applications, which typically use these protocols for real-time communication.
   
3. **Elasticity**:
   - NLB automatically scales up or down to handle changes in traffic, ensuring that the game server can handle sudden surges in player activity, such as when a new game season starts.

4. **High Availability**:
   - With **Cross-Zone Load Balancing** and **health checks**, NLB ensures that traffic is always routed to healthy EC2 instances. If one AZ or instance becomes unavailable, traffic is seamlessly routed to healthy targets in other AZs, ensuring that players can continue their game without interruption.

5. **Static IP and IP Preservation**:
   - NLB provides **static IPs** for the game server (for example, for external game clients to connect), which can be beneficial for players and external services that need a fixed IP address to connect to the game server.

---

### **Conclusion**

In this example, **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is used to handle **high-performance, low-latency TCP** traffic for a real-time **multiplayer game**. The NLB distributes incoming game requests to multiple EC2 instances running the game backend across multiple Availability Zones. This setup provides scalability, availability, and fault tolerance, ensuring a smooth and responsive gaming experience for users.
