# **AWS CloudWatch Events (Amazon EventBridge) - Deep Dive 🚀**  

## **1. What is CloudWatch Events / Amazon EventBridge?**  
AWS **CloudWatch Events** (now part of **Amazon EventBridge**) is a **serverless event bus** that allows you to **detect, respond to, and route AWS service events** in real-time.  

### **Why Use Amazon EventBridge?**  
✅ **Automate workflows** – Trigger Lambda, Step Functions, or ECS tasks  
✅ **Event-driven architecture** – Connect AWS services and third-party apps  
✅ **Real-time monitoring** – Capture AWS service state changes  
✅ **Schedule periodic tasks** – Run scheduled jobs like cron  

---

## **2. Key Concepts of Amazon EventBridge**  

### 🔹 **1️⃣ Event Sources**  
- **AWS services** – EC2, S3, Lambda, SageMaker, etc.  
- **Custom applications** – You can send your own events.  
- **Third-party SaaS apps** – Shopify, Datadog, Zendesk, etc.  

### 🔹 **2️⃣ Event Buses**  
- Default **AWS Event Bus** – Receives all AWS service events.  
- **Custom Event Buses** – You can create your own event bus.  
- **Partner Event Buses** – Used for SaaS integrations.  

### 🔹 **3️⃣ Event Rules**  
- Define **which events** to capture and **where to send them** (targets).  
- Filter events based on JSON pattern matching.  

### 🔹 **4️⃣ Event Targets**  
- The **action** to take when an event occurs.  
- Examples:  
  ✅ Trigger **Lambda**  
  ✅ Start an **EC2 instance**  
  ✅ Run an **ECS task**  
  ✅ Notify via **SNS or SQS**

## **3. How Does EventBridge Work?**  
1️⃣ **An AWS service generates an event** (e.g., an S3 object is uploaded).  
2️⃣ **EventBridge captures the event** in an **event bus**.  
3️⃣ **A rule matches the event** based on defined filters.  
4️⃣ **The rule routes the event** to a target (e.g., Lambda, SNS, SQS).  

---

## **4. Example Use Cases**  
| Scenario | Example Event | Target Action |  
|----------|--------------|--------------|  
| **Auto-start EC2 on request** | EC2 instance stopped | Lambda function starts the instance |  
| **Trigger Lambda on S3 Upload** | S3 object created | Lambda function for processing |  
| **Auto-scale ECS Tasks** | High CPU usage in ECS | ECS Service scales up |  
| **Notify on Failed CodePipeline Deployment** | CodePipeline fails | Send SNS notification |  
| **Run Daily Batch Jobs** | Scheduled time | Start Step Function workflow |  

---

## **5. Example: Creating an EventBridge Rule**  

### **1️⃣ Example: Trigger Lambda on S3 File Upload**
💡 **Scenario**: When a new file is uploaded to an **S3 bucket**, trigger an AWS **Lambda function**.  

#### **Step 1: Create Event Rule**  
```json
{
  "source": ["aws.s3"],
  "detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"],
  "detail": {
    "eventSource": ["s3.amazonaws.com"],
    "eventName": ["PutObject"],
    "requestParameters": {
      "bucketName": ["my-s3-bucket"]
    }
  }
}
```
📌 **This rule captures `PutObject` events from S3 and filters for `my-s3-bucket`.**  

#### **Step 2: Set Target as Lambda Function**  
- **Target:** Select your Lambda function.  
- **Save the rule.**  

✅ Now, whenever a file is uploaded to `my-s3-bucket`, the Lambda function is triggered!  

---

### **2️⃣ Example: Start an EC2 Instance on Demand**
💡 **Scenario**: Start an EC2 instance when an event is published to a custom event bus.  

#### **Step 1: Send a Custom Event via AWS CLI**
```sh
aws events put-events --entries '[
  {
    "Source": "custom.app",
    "DetailType": "StartEC2",
    "Detail": "{\"instance-id\": \"i-1234567890abcdef0\"}",
    "EventBusName": "default"
  }
]'
```
📌 **This sends an event to EventBridge with the EC2 instance ID.**  

#### **Step 2: Create Event Rule to Capture the Event**
```json
{
  "source": ["custom.app"],
  "detail-type": ["StartEC2"]
}
```

#### **Step 3: Set Target as an AWS Lambda Function**
- The Lambda function will read the event and start the EC2 instance:  

```python
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    instance_id = event['detail']['instance-id']
    ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
    print(f"Started EC2 Instance: {instance_id}")
```

✅ Now, whenever an event with `detail-type: StartEC2` is published, the EC2 instance **starts automatically**! 🚀

## **6. Scheduling Events (Cron Jobs in AWS)**  
Amazon EventBridge allows you to **run scheduled tasks** like a **cron job**.

### **Example: Run a Lambda Function Every Day at Midnight**
1️⃣ Go to **Amazon EventBridge** → **Rules** → **Create Rule**  
2️⃣ Select **Schedule**  
3️⃣ Enter **Cron Expression**:  
   ```
   cron(0 0 * * ? *)
   ```
   ✅ Runs **every day at midnight UTC**  
4️⃣ Set **Target** as Lambda  

📌 **Use Cases**:  
✅ **Cleanup old data**  
✅ **Send daily reports**  
✅ **Run backup jobs**  

---

## **7. Monitoring and Logging Events**  
### **✅ View Event Logs in CloudWatch**  
- All events processed by **EventBridge** can be monitored in **CloudWatch Logs**.  

### **✅ Debugging Events in AWS Console**  
- Go to **Amazon EventBridge → Event Buses**  
- Select an event bus and view recent **event activity**  

### **✅ Set Up Alarms for Event Failures**  
- Create a **CloudWatch Alarm** for failed event deliveries.  

---

## **8. Best Practices for Amazon EventBridge**  
✅ **Use multiple event buses** – Separate events by app/service.  
✅ **Use detail-type filters** – Avoid unnecessary event processing.  
✅ **Monitor failed invocations** – Use **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)**.  
✅ **Limit event retries** – Prevent infinite loops.  
✅ **Secure events** – Use **IAM permissions** to control access.

## **9. Conclusion**  
AWS **CloudWatch Events (EventBridge)** is a **powerful event-driven** service that enables **automation, monitoring, and integration** across AWS services. By leveraging **event rules, custom events, and scheduled triggers**, you can **build scalable serverless architectures**. 🚀
