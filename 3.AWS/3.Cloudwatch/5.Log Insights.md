## **3. Writing Queries in CloudWatch Logs Insights**  

### **Basic Syntax**
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 10
```
### **Key Query Commands**
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **fields** | Selects specific fields to display | `fields @timestamp, @message` |
| **filter** | Filters logs based on a condition | `filter @message like /ERROR/` |
| **sort** | Orders results in ascending/descending order | `sort @timestamp desc` |
| **limit** | Limits the number of results returned | `limit 10` |
| **stats** | Aggregates data (count, sum, avg) | `stats count(*) by status` |
| **parse** | Extracts structured data from logs | `parse @message "status: *" as status_code` |

## **4. CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Examples**  

### 🔹 **1️⃣ Find Error Messages in Logs**
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 10
```
📌 **Use Case**: Quickly locate application errors.

---

### 🔹 **2️⃣ Find All HTTP 5xx Errors in API Gateway Logs**
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message, httpMethod, path, status
| filter status >= 500
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```
📌 **Use Case**: Detect API failures.

---

### 🔹 **3️⃣ Count Log Events by Log Level**
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| parse @message "level=*," as log_level
| stats count(*) by log_level
```
📌 **Use Case**: See how many logs are `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`.

---

### 🔹 **4️⃣ Identify Slowest API Requests**
```sql
fields @timestamp, httpMethod, path, latency
| sort latency desc
| limit 10
```
📌 **Use Case**: Pinpoint API requests with the longest response times.

---

### 🔹 **5️⃣ Find Failed Login Attempts**
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /failed login/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 10
```
📌 **Use Case**: Detect security threats.

---

### 🔹 **6️⃣ Count Requests by HTTP Status Code**
```sql
fields status
| stats count(*) by status
```
📌 **Use Case**: Monitor API request health.

---

### 🔹 **7️⃣ Extract and Analyze JSON Logs**
If your logs are **JSON-formatted**, you can extract fields easily:  
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message, requestId, responseTime
| filter responseTime > 5000
| sort @timestamp desc
```
📌 **Use Case**: Find API requests that took longer than **5 seconds**.

---

### 🔹 **8️⃣ Detect Spikes in Log Volume Over Time**
```sql
stats count(*) as log_count by bin(5m)
```
📌 **Use Case**: Identify unusual traffic patterns (e.g., DDoS attacks).

---

## **5. Visualizing CloudWatch Logs Insights Queries**  
You can **turn query results into charts** and **add them to CloudWatch Dashboards**.

### **Steps to Visualize Logs Insights Data**  
1️⃣ Run a query in **CloudWatch Logs Insights**  
2️⃣ Click **Visualization** (Table, Line Chart, Bar Chart)  
3️⃣ Click **Add to Dashboard**  
4️⃣ Choose a CloudWatch Dashboard  

---

## **6. Automating Log Queries with AWS CLI**  
You can run CloudWatch Logs Insights queries using the **AWS CLI**:

```sh
aws logs start-query \
  --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/my-function" \
  --start-time $(date -d '-1 hour' +%s)000 \
  --end-time $(date +%s)000 \
  --query-string "fields @timestamp, @message | filter @message like /ERROR/ | sort @timestamp desc | limit 10"
```

## **7. Best Practices for CloudWatch Logs Insights**  
✅ **Use `limit` to improve query performance** – Avoid querying unnecessary data.  
✅ **Create saved queries for repeated use** – Save your most used queries.  
✅ **Use `stats` for aggregations** – Helps in performance monitoring.  
✅ **Stream logs to Amazon OpenSearch** for advanced analytics.  
✅ **Set up alarms on query results** – Detect patterns like repeated errors.
