AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that helps you track performance, collect logs, and respond to operational changes in AWS resources and applications. Here are the key concepts:

### **1. Metrics**
- **Definition**: Time-series data points that represent the performance of AWS resources (e.g., CPU usage, memory utilization, request count).
- **Example**: `CPUUtilization` metric for an EC2 instance.
- **Namespaces**: Metrics are organized in namespaces (e.g., `AWS/EC2`, `AWS/Lambda`).

### **2. Alarms**
- **Definition**: A mechanism to monitor metric thresholds and trigger actions.
- **Example**: If an EC2 instanceâ€™s CPU usage exceeds 80% for 5 minutes, an alarm can trigger an Auto Scaling event or send an SNS notification.
- **Alarm States**:
  - **OK**: Metric is within the defined threshold.
  - **ALARM**: Metric has crossed the threshold.
  - **INSUFFICIENT_DATA**: Not enough data points to determine the state.

### **3. Logs**
- **Definition**: Captures and stores application/system logs from AWS services.
- **Example**: Lambda function logs, VPC flow logs, and ECS container logs.
- **CloudWatch Log Groups & Streams**:
  - **Log Group**: A collection of log streams with retention settings.
  - **Log Stream**: A sequence of log events from the same source.

### **4. Log Insights**
- **Definition**: A query language to analyze CloudWatch logs.
- **Example**: Running a query to find error messages in Lambda logs.

### **5. Events (Amazon EventBridge)**
- **Definition**: A near real-time event-driven system that reacts to changes in AWS services.
- **Example**: Automatically triggers a Lambda function when an EC2 instance state changes.

### **6. Dashboards**
- **Definition**: Custom visualizations of metrics and logs for monitoring.
- **Example**: A dashboard showing EC2 CPU usage, RDS latency, and Lambda execution errors.

### **7. Contributor Insights**
- **Definition**: Analyzes log data to find trends, such as which IP addresses are making the most API requests.
- **Example**: Detecting high API request volume from a specific IP.

### **8. Anomaly Detection**
- **Definition**: Uses machine learning to automatically detect abnormal metric behavior.
- **Example**: Detecting unusual spikes in API request latency.
